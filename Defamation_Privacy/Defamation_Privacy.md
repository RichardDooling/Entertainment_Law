## Defamation - Privacy 

# "Life Story Rights" 

Do artists have a First Amendment right to tell stories, or write songs, or make movies that someone else believes defames them? Invades their privacy? “Steals” their “life story”?

Sometimes called "life story rights," these rights are usually a simple
agreement not to sue for defamation, invasion of privacy, and many other
claims. But what are these claims and how can you advise clients about making works of
art that skirt too close to the edge? Can a book or a movie or a
docu-drama arguably defame someone, even though they are never mentioned
by name? If your client makes a documentary and wears hidden microphones and
cameras to film a quack doctor who is selling banned substances or
unsafe herbal remedies does the client risk an invasion of privacy claim?

The catch-all "life story rights" is not a legal term, just a handy grab bag term for the rights involved. The artist (filmmaker, storyteller, photographer, fine artist, even songwriters) wants to tell a person's "life story" or use their name, image or likeness without getting sued for it. Therefore, artist and living subject execute a simple agreement, wherein the subject promises not to sue for defamation, invasion of privacy, use of name, image, or likeness, and a number of other claims. A nice description can be found in a passage called [“Fact-Based Stories”](http://www.richarddooling.com/ArtBizLaw/Fact_Based_Stories.pdf) from the [Independent Producers Survival Guide: A Business and Legal Sourcebook][survival] 4th Ed. (2009), by Gunnar Erickson, Mark Halloran & Harris Tulchin.  

In the international context, these rights are all jurisdiction-specific and depend on careful, specific drafting of contract provisions.  

## Defamation

Stories, songs, movies, even photos about real people, may defame them, especially if those works of art contain or suggest false statements of fact.

### Headline Cases

*   [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=376+us+254&appflag=67.12), 376 U.S. 254 (1964). [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan)
*   [NYTimes Editorial: The Uninhibited Press 50 Years Later](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/the-uninhibited-press-50-years-later.html).

### Defamation

Two forms: Libel and slander.

* Libel (mneumonic sounds like "label") is defamation in print; it's written or recorded, as in television or movies.   
* Slander is defamation by way of the spoken word.

The plaintiff suing for defamation must be able to prove:

1. The defendant communicated a false statement of fact about the plaintiff; 
2. The defendant was not "privileged" to make the communication, and the communication was "published" to at least one other party;
3. Fault, meaning at least negligence, on the part of the defendant;
    - Public officials and public figures must prove fault amounting to "actual malice," meaning they must prove that the defendant knew that the communication was false or had reckless disregard for its truth or falsity;  
4. The communication harmed the plaintiff's reputation by lowering his or her standing in at least some part of the community.

Defamatory communications tend to expose another to hatred, ridicule or contempt. 

> A statement is *defamatory* if it is false and tends to "harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him." [Restatement 2nd of Torts §559](http://tinyurl.com/ksezohp)

The communication:

> need not tend to prejudice the other in the eyes of everyone in the community or of all of his associates, nor even in the eyes of a majority of them. It is enough that the communication would tend to prejudice him in the eyes of a substantial and respectable minority of them, and that it is made to one or more of them or in a manner that makes it proper to assume that it will reach them.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts §559](http://tinyurl.com/ksezohp)

#### Defamation Per Se

All states, except Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee, recognize that some categories of false statements are so innately harmful that they are considered to be defamatory per se. In the common law tradition, damages for such false statements are presumed and do not have to be proven.

Statements are defamatory per se where they falsely impute to the plaintiff one or more of the following:

1. Allegations or imputations "injurious to another in their trade, business, or profession"
2. Allegations or imputations "of loathsome disease" (historically leprosy and sexually transmitted disease, now also includes mental illness)
3. Allegations or imputations of "unchastity" (usually only in unmarried people and sometimes only in women)
4. Allegations or imputations of criminal activity (sometimes only crimes of [moral turpitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_turpitude))

[Wikipedia: Defamation Per Se](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law#Defamation_per_se)

#### Lawsuits Over False Statements of Fact

Different rules for different types of people who might take offense at entertainment stories. 

- Private Figures (Ordinary People)
- Public Officials (Politicians) 
- Public Figures (Celebrities)
- Limited Purpose Public Figures (ordinary people who suddenly become famous because of their association with a particular event or issue)  

If a public official or a public figure (celebrity) wishes to sue someone for defaming them they must prove [actual malice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice).

> One who publishes a false and defamatory communication concerning a public official or public figure in regard to his conduct, fitness or role in that capacity is subject to liability, if, but only if, he:

> 1.  knows that the statement is false and that it defames the other person, or
> 2.  acts in reckless disregard of these matters.

[§ 580A Restatement 2nd of Torts: Defamation of Public Official or Public Figure](http://tinyurl.com/kmvz6gy)

##### International Comparisons

Should the law force the defamed plaintiff to prove that the communications were false? Or should we instead force the defendant media company to prove that they are true? 

The rule that somebody alleging defamation should have to prove untruth, rather than that the defendant should have to prove the truth of a statement, stood as a departure from the previous common law. 

In England, the development was specifically rejected in [*Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-local-authorities-cannot-institute-libel-actions-derbyshire-county-council-v-times-newspapers-ltd-and-others--house-of-lords-lord-keith-lord-griffiths-lord-goff-of-chieveley-lord-brownewilkinson-and-lord-woolf-18-february-1993-1473954.html) (1993), and it was also rejected in Canada in [*Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_v._Church_of_Scientology_of_Toronto) (1995), and more recently in [*Grant v. Torstar Corp.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_v._Torstar_Corp.) (2009). 

In Australia, the High Court held in [*Theophanous v. The Herald & Weekly Times Ltd*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanous_v_Herald_%26_Weekly_Times_Ltd) (1994) that the Australian constitution implied a freedom of political communication and a freedom to publish material discussing government and political matters, but *Theophanous* was overruled by the High Court of Australia in [*Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_v_Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation) (1997).

##### Courtney Love & Defamation via Twitter

- [Courtney Love commits defamation via Twitter--Twice!][courtney]
- [Courtney Love wins 'Twibel' case][twibel]

> Because the attorney was deemed to be a limited-purpose public figure as a result of her connection to a celebrity, Holmes needed to demonstrate that Love acted with malice. Love defended herself by saying she meant the tweet to be a private direct message, and when she learned it had been sent to the public accidentally, quickly deleted it.

> Love also testified that she believed her message to be true when she sent it. That might have been the prevailing defense. The jury answered no to the question, "Did Rhonda Holmes prove by clear and convincing evidence that Courtney Love knew it was false or doubted the truth of it?"

##### Who Are "The News Media?"

Blurred lines: Ninth Circuit applies same First Amendment protections to bloggers as traditional media. [Bloggers enjoy same First Amendment Protections as Traditional Media.](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=70eecbf8-59ac-46b1-8a8a-253e26d7b843&l=7KKVEH6).

## Privacy Rights 

### Invasion of Privacy

Privacy rights come in four different flavors, best described by Justice Louis Brandeis in a famous [1890 Harvard Law Review article][brandeis_article] as "the right to be left alone." 

1. Intrusion - Unreasonable intrusion on personal solitude.
2. Publication of Private Facts - Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.
3. False Light - Presentation of people in a false light in the public eye.
4. Celebrity Publicity Rights - Appropriation of one's name, image, or likeness.

* [If Only J-Law Could Retain Brandeis](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-05/if-only-j-law-could-retain-brandeis?alcmpid=view).

#### 1. Intrusion Upon Seclusion

> One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652B: Intrusion upon Seclusion](http://tinyurl.com/lqqgzng)

#### 2. Publication of Private Facts

###### aka Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that:

> (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652D: Publicity Given to Private Life](http://tinyurl.com/njkdaxt)

#### 3. False Light

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if:

> (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652E: Publicity Placing Person in False Light](http://tinyurl.com/lbhzrf5)

False light is a close cousin to defamation, and the two torts are often pled together. In [*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=769+F.2d+1128&appflag=67.12) (7th Cir 1985), Judge Richard Posner explained the difference this way:

> The false-light tort, to the extent distinct from the tort of defamation (but there is indeed considerable overlap), rests on an awareness that people who are made to seem pathetic or ridiculous may be shunned, and not just people who are thought to be dishonest or incompetent or
immoral. 

Defamation focuses on the damage to the plaintiff’s reputation in the community, while false light privacy concentrates on the psychological harm done to the plaintiff from objectionable misrepresentations.

### Headline Case

##### *Shulman v. Group W. Productions* (CA 1998) 

*  [*Shulman v. Group W.  Productions*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=955+P.2d+469&appflag=67.12), 955 P.2d 469 (Cal. Sct. 1998).

A medical news team (with a private paramedic and a ride-along cameraman) covered a car crash in which Ruth Shulman was gravely injured. The news team filmed the scene and put a mic on a nurse, who went into the helicopter where Ruth Shulman was being treated for her injuries.

The accident turned Ruth Shulman into a paraplegic. The news team videotaped her saying things like, “I just want to die. I don’t want to go through with this.” Shulman was in a state of shock at the accident scene, so she did not recall that her statements were videotaped and recorded.

Three months after the accident, Ruth Shulman watched herself on *On Scene: Emergency Response*, a reality news show. The producers did not use her last name, but Shulman was upset that her comments and images of her were enhanced, and then aired on national television – without her permission. 

Ruth Shulman sued for invasion of privacy. Her case was dismissed when the Superior Court ruled that the media had a First Amendment right to videotape and broadcast the sights and sounds of her ordeal. 

Shulman then appealed to the California Supreme Court. In an important decision for the right of privacy, the Supreme Court found for Ruth Shulman by ruling that the reality TV show producers intruded on Ruth Shulman's right of privacy at the scene of the highway accident by filming and recording her ordeal without her permission.
