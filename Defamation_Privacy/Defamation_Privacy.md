## Defamation - Privacy 

### "Life Story Rights" 

Artists have First Amendment rights to tell stories, or write songs, or make movies, but what happens when those speech rights collide with the rights of others? What if the artist's free speech defames someone else? Invades their privacy? "Steals" their "life story"? Publicly discloses embarrassing private facts about their lives?

Every major film attracts lawsuits, and some plaintiffs sue even though they are not mentioned by name. Docu-dramas invite litigation. Imagine documentary filmmakers wearing hidden microphones and cameras making a documentary about a quack doctor who is selling banned substances, or unsafe herbal remedies? Invasion of privacy? 

Telling "based upon," nonfiction stories about others often treads on what the industry calls "life story rights," not a legal term, just a handy grab bag term for the rights involved. The artist (filmmaker, storyteller, photographer, fine artist, even songwriters) wants to tell a person's "life story" or use their name, image or likeness without getting sued for it.

If possible artist and living subject execute a simple agreement, wherein the subject promises not to sue for defamation, invasion of privacy, use of name, image, or likeness, and a number of other claims. A nice description can be found in a passage called ["Fact-Based Stories"](http://www.richarddooling.com/ArtBizLaw/Fact_Based_Stories.pdf) from the [Independent Producers Survival Guide: A Business and Legal Sourcebook][survival] 4th Ed. (2009), by Gunnar Erickson, Mark Halloran & Harris Tulchin. 

If an agreement can't be had, storytellers and filmmakers may proceed, but often the script or the nonfiction book will be annotated with sources for any factual statements made about real people, and permissions will be obtained to use anyone's name image or likeness. 

In the international context, these rights are all jurisdiction-specific and depend on careful, specific drafting of contract provisions. 

Let's look first at defamation.

### Defamation

Stories, songs, movies, even photos about real people, may defame them, especially if those works of art contain or suggest false statements of fact.

### Libel v. Slander

Two forms: Libel and slander.

* Libel (mneumonic sounds like "label") is defamation in print; it's written or recorded, as in television or movies.   
* Slander is defamation by way of the spoken word.

#### Defamation Per Se

All states, except Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee, recognize that some categories of false statements are so harmful that they are considered to be defamatory per se. In the common law tradition, damages for such false statements are presumed and do not have to be proven.

Statements are defamatory per se where they falsely impute to the plaintiff one or more of the following:

1. Allegations or imputations "injurious to another in their trade, business, or profession"
2. Allegations or imputations "of loathsome disease" (historically leprosy and sexually transmitted disease, now also includes mental illness)
3. Allegations or imputations of "unchastity" (usually only in unmarried people and sometimes only in women)
4. Allegations or imputations of criminal activity (sometimes only crimes of [moral turpitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_turpitude))

### Defamation Meets First Amendment

Sometimes called the constitutionalization of defamation law, [*New York Times v. Sullivan*][sullivan] changed everything for public officials who don't like the way they are portrayed in the press. It all started in Montgomery, Alabama and the civil rights movement in the South. 

#### Elements

First let's look at the rules for stating a claim for defamation as they existed before [*New York Time v. Sullivan*][sullivan]. 

A plaintiff suing for defamation had to prove:

1. A statement had been made about the plaintiff;
2. The statement had been "published" to at least one other party;
3. The statement was false (presumed at common law);
4. The statement harmed the subject's reputation by lowering his or her standing in at least some part of the community.

## New York Times v. Sullivan

###### US Supreme Court 1964

* [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=376+us+254&appflag=67.12), 376 U.S. 254 (1964). 
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan).
* [NYTimes Editorial: The Uninhibited Press 50 Years Later](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/the-uninhibited-press-50-years-later.html).
* [Image of "Heed Their Rising Voices" ad][heed]'
* [Transcript of "Heed Their Rising Voices ad][heed_transcript] 

On March 29th, 1960, civil rights groups, including The Committee To Defend Martin Luther King and The Struggle For Freedom In The South ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times. The ad, captioned ["Heed Their Rising Voices,"][heed], began:

> As the whole world knows by now, thousands of Southern Negro students are engaged in wide-spread non-violent demonstrations in positive affirma-tion of the right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In their efforts to uphold these guarantees, they are being met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate that document which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom.

The ad went on to list examples of official police intimidation and alleged that certain actions and events had deprived the students and demonstrators of their rights. 

> It is uncontroverted that some of the statements contained in the two paragraphs were not accurate descriptions of events which occurred in Montgomery.

L.B. Sullivan was the police commisioner for the city of Montgomery. Even though he wasn't named in the ad, Sullivan filed suit against the *New York Times*, alleging that it had wongfully implied that he was guilty of misconduct. Four other suits were filed by other government officials. 

At trial the evidence showed that at least some of the statements in the ad were incorrect. The trial jury awarded Sullivan $500,000 in damages, and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the verdict. 

A unanimous Supreme Court reversed, in essence overruling Alabama's interpretation of its own defamation laws. The Court held that the First Amendment required that in defamation actions brought by public officials, the plaintiff official must prove that the statement was made with "*actual malice*"--meaning it was made *with knowledge that the statement was false* or *with reckeless disregard for the truth*. 

> We consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide- open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public official.

To protect news organizations from defamation claims, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution required public officials to prove actual malice to state a claim. Not only that, but in defamation cases, appellate court were charged with the duty to examine *the entire record* on review to insure that a trial judgement did not tread on First Amendment freedoms. 

#### Lawsuits Over False Statements of Fact

In the wake of *New York Times v. Sullivan,* the defamation rules changed and prospective plaintiffs were sorted into at least four different categories: 

- Private Figures (Ordinary People)
- Public Officials (Politicians) 
- Public Figures (Celebrities)
- Limited Purpose Public Figures (ordinary people who suddenly become famous because of their association with a particular event or issue)  

If a public official or a public figure (celebrity) wishes to sue someone for defaming them they must prove [actual malice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice).

> One who publishes a false and defamatory communication concerning a public official or public figure in regard to his conduct, fitness or role in that capacity is subject to liability, if, but only if, he:

> 1.  knows that the statement is false and that it defames the other person, or
> 2.  acts in reckless disregard of these matters.

[§ 580A Restatement 2nd of Torts: Defamation of Public Official or Public Figure](http://tinyurl.com/kmvz6gy)

#### International Comparisons

Should the law force the allegedly defamed plaintiff to prove that the communications were false? Or should we instead force the defendant media company to prove that the statements were true? 

The rule that somebody alleging defamation should have to prove untruth, rather than that the defendant should have to prove the truth of a statement, stood as a departure from the previous common law. 

In England, the development was specifically rejected in [*Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-local-authorities-cannot-institute-libel-actions-derbyshire-county-council-v-times-newspapers-ltd-and-others--house-of-lords-lord-keith-lord-griffiths-lord-goff-of-chieveley-lord-brownewilkinson-and-lord-woolf-18-february-1993-1473954.html) (1993), and it was also rejected in Canada in [*Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_v._Church_of_Scientology_of_Toronto) (1995), and more recently in [*Grant v. Torstar Corp.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_v._Torstar_Corp.) (2009). 

In Australia, the High Court held in [*Theophanous v. The Herald & Weekly Times Ltd*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanous_v_Herald_%26_Weekly_Times_Ltd) (1994) that the Australian constitution implied a freedom of political communication and a freedom to publish material discussing government and political matters, but *Theophanous* was overruled by the High Court of Australia in [*Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_v_Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation) (1997).

Now let's look at some entertainment industry cases where public officials and figures alleged defamation.

## Davis v. Constantin Costa-Gavras,

###### US District Court, S.D. New York (1987)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15465616831450742963)
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=654fsupp653&appflag=67.12)
* [Loyola Entertainment Law Journal Case Note](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1134&context=elr).

A summary of events leading up to the lawsuit:

> Thomas Hauser wrote a book, *The Execution of Charles Horman,* which developed the thesis of Ed Horman, Charles' father, that the US military in Chile had known and approved of the killing of his son by Pinochet's troops. Four years later, Costa-Gavras made a well-received movie, *Missing*, starring Jack Lemmon in the role of Ed Horman and Sally Field as his wife. *Missing* was a fictionalized version of the book, *Execution*, with the U.S. military head named Ray Tower. Davis, who had not sued the book's author or publisher, sued the movie director and studio for defamation. The legal issue posed by the case was whether there was any evidence of "actual malice" that would satisfy the *New York Times* standard.

> Paul C. Weiler, Gary Myers, *Entertainment, Media, and the Law: Text, Cases, and Problems* (4th Ed. 2011).

MILTON POLLACK, Senior District Judge.

The defamation charged in the complaint is that in their film, "Missing," defendants (including Universal Studios) allegedly portrayed with actual malice that plaintiff, the Commander of the United States Military Group and Chief of the United States Mission to Chile at the time of the 1973 coup in Chile, ordered or approved a Chilean order to kill Charles Horman, an American residing in Chile.

Actual malice is established in a public figure defamation litigation only where defendant publishes a statement "with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." [*New York Times v. Sullivan,* (S.Ct. 1964) ][sullivan]. Reckless disregard in such a case means that a defendant published after he "in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication." [*St. Amant v. Thompson* (S.Ct. 1968.)][amant]

### *Designated Evidence Offered by Plaintiff*

Plaintiff alleges that there are four general categories of purported
evidence in the paper defense to the motion from which to find actual
malice on behalf of defendants: 

1. that defendants' "entire purpose in making 'Missing' was to show plaintiff as responsible for Charles Horman's death"; 
2. that defendants' reliance on Thomas Hauser's book *The Execution of Charles Horman ("Execution ")* was unreasonable; 
3. that defendants never consulted with plaintiff on the facts presented in the film; and 
4. that "Missing" contains scenes portraying certain episodes which defendants knew were embroidered.

An analysis of the record shows that to accept the plaintiff's opposition to summary judgment would require a distortion of the proofs, deviation from applicable law, and wrenching of the film out of its plain context.

#### A. *The Thesis of the Film*

Plaintiff has produced no evidence in his papers to substantiate his
assertion that the purpose of "Missing" was to make a non-fictional film
establishing that Ray Davis, the plaintiff, was responsible for Charles
Horman's death. To the contrary, the papers unalterably establish that
the film is not a non-fictional documentary or aimed at Ray Davis as an
individual, and that it cannot be understood as other than a
dramatization of a true story. The film includes fictional characters
and a composite portrayal of the American military presence in Chile at
the time of the uprising and Allende coup.

The theme of the film is the search for a missing man by his father and
his wife. The man who disappeared is finally found to have been executed
by the Chilean military. The film is *based upon* a true story. It is
only in that setting that the composite conduct of the American
governmental representatives in Chile at the time and the degree of
their assistance in that search comes under scrutiny and criticism.
There is no person named Ray Davis referred to in the film at any time.
Ray Tower, with whom the plaintiff associates himself, is a symbolic
fictional composite of the entire American political and military
entourage in Chile.

The film derives from and is solidly documented and supported by the
stories relied on by the filmmakers, taken from the acts and statements
of the concerned father and the anguished wife set forth in detail in
Thomas Hauser's book, *Execution.* Those sources are shown to have been
heavily investigated and confirmed by the filmmakers, who entertained no
serious doubts of their truth or knowledge to the contrary of what they
portrayed.

We pause to point out that the Supreme Court has emphasized that "actual
malice" in the context of the First Amendment does not even include
"spite, hostility or intention to harm." &hellip; Rather, the actual malice inquiry
focuses on the publisher's state of mind regarding the truth of his
statements.&hellip;

#### B. *Defendants' Reliance on Hauser's Book*

"Missing" is a dramatic portrayal of events and interpretations detailed
in Thomas Hauser's book, *Execution.* The substance of the movie's
scenes is extracted directly from *Execution.* To meet those facts,
plaintiff purports to suggest that defendants' reliance on Hauser's book
was unreasonable and that Hauser's credentials would have disclosed him
to be "suspect" had a good faith search by defendants been made.

As a matter of law, to prevail on a defamation claim against a public
official a plaintiff must do more than propound potential avenues of
investigation that a defendant might have pursued. "[M]ere proof of
failure to investigate, without more, cannot establish reckless
disregard for the truth." [*Gertz v. Robert Welch* (S.Ct. 1974)][gertz], 

> Rather, a public figure defamation plaintiff must show either that the
publisher actually entertained serious doubts about the veracity of the
publication, or that there are '*obvious* reasons to doubt the veracity
of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.'"&hellip; 

There is nothing in the record tending to show that the filmmakers
questioned Hauser's credentials or his book in any respect at the time
"Missing" was made. The record is to the contrary. The filmmakers met
with Hauser, went over his investigation and sources, supplied him with
drafts of the script under preparation and were satisfied that there was
no reason to doubt his work. No evidence whatever challenges those
facts. Certainly the filmmakers obtained no knowledge contradicting the
veracity or accuracy of Hauser's book and the stories of the Hormans as
told to them and reflected in the book. There is no suggestion to the
contrary from any provable sources. Indeed, nothing in plaintiff's
papers demonstrates that either Hauser's credentials or his book, which
was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, are in fact "suspect" in any way.

The filmmakers knew that Hauser was a lawyer who had served as a
judicial clerk in the Chambers of a Federal Judge and then worked for a
prestigious Wall Street law firm. They knew that Hauser interviewed
Captain Ray Davis, as well as other United States officials in Chile and
numerous other persons when preparing *Execution.* The filmmakers also
knew that no legal action whatsoever was taken against the book in the
approximately four years since its publication. In an August 1980
meeting where Costa-Gavras, the film's director, and Stewart, the
co-scriptwriter, met with Hauser to verify the accuracy of his book,
Hauser described his meticulous research methods and broad inquiries.
There is no evidence to the contrary.

The filmmakers then met with Charles Horman's parents, his wife, and one
Terry Simon, a close friend who was in Chile with Charles around the
time of his disappearance. Each of these individuals made clear to
Costa-Gavras and Stewart that Hauser's book accurately and reliably
depicted events as they knew and believed them. There is no evidence
that any of defendants' further research and review of documents
 regarding Horman and events in Chile during the coup caused
them to doubt the veracity of Hauser's book.

Plaintiff argues that an effective search of Hauser's background would
have disclosed "fraudulent letters" sent by Hauser to political figures
and The New York Times. This allusion is to Hauser's political satires
where he had written on public issues to officials in the voice of a
nine-year old boy, "Martin Bear." The New York Times, in fact, solicited
from Hauser and published on its "op-ed" page one of these satirical
pieces, which can hardly be reason to "suspect" the veracity of his
book.

In any event, plaintiff has neither presented nor designated specific
facts suggesting or from which it could be reasonably inferred and found
that defendants entertained serious doubts as to Hauser's account or
that there were obvious reasons to doubt the veracity or accuracy of
Hauser's book. Absent such evidence, reliance on *Execution* is not
evidence of actual malice. [*Herbert v. Lando*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16697660620075994229) (plaintiff must show either that publisher "entertained serious doubts"
or "obvious reasons" to doubt source). [*St. Amant*][amant] ("[R]eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published or would have investigated before publishing.")

#### C. *Failure to Consult Plaintiff Prior to Making Film*

Plaintiff argues that defendant's failure to consult plaintiff
personally prior to presentation of the film is evidence of actual
malice.

However, plaintiff cannot prove actual malice merely by asserting that a publisher failed to contact the subject of his work. *See* [*Vandenburg v. Newsweek, Inc.* (5th Cir.1975)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6613184420209694118) (failure to verify story with plaintiff prior to publication insufficient evidence of actual malice.).

The actual malice standard cannot be satisfied by evidence of a
failure to check with third parties prior to publication without proof
that a publisher knew his publication was false, entertained serious
doubts as to its truth, or had obvious reasons to doubt the veracity or
accuracy of the source of published information. *See* [*New York Times
v. Sullivan*][sullivan] (and others). 

While "verification of facts" of a story with its subjects and with
others is a desirable and responsible practice and "an important
reporting standard, a reporter, without a 'high degree of awareness of
their probable falsity,' may rely on statements made by a single source
even though they reflect only one side of the story without fear of
libel prosecution.&hellip;" [*New York Times v. Connor* (5th
Cir.1966)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7290867114825816634). 

Plaintiff has not designated specific facts suggesting an awareness or
even suspicion by defendants of probable falsity of their source
material.

#### D. *Scenes in "Missing" as Evidence Of Actual Malice*

Plaintiff enumerates nine scenes in "Missing" which the filmmakers
allegedly created, or in which they distorted the context, or made
baseless suggestions. None of these scenes provides or contributes to
the requisite evidence of actual malice.

It should be made clear that "Missing" is not a documentary, but a
dramatization of the Horman disappearance and search. The film does not
purport to depict a chronology of the events precisely as they actually
occurred; it opens with the prologue: "This film is *based on* a true
story. The incidents and facts are documented. Some of the names have
been changed to protect the innocent and also to protect the film."
(emphasis supplied). No one challenged the accuracy and veracity of
Hauser's book to the knowledge of defendants. Defendants concede that
although the substance of the film's scenes is extracted almost directly
from Thomas Hauser's book, not  everything in their film is
literally faithful to the actual historical record as if in a
documentary. That is not to say that which was not historical was set
out in bad faith, portrayed with actual malice, or established or
increased the defamatory impact.

The film is not a documentary. A documentary is a non-fictional story or
series of historical events portrayed in their actual location; a film
of real people and real events as they occur. A documentary maintains
strict fidelity to fact.

"Missing," on the other hand, is an art form sometimes described as
"Docu-Drama." The line separating a documentary from a docudrama is not
always sharply defined, but is nonetheless discernible. Both forms are
necessarily selective, given the time constraints of movies and the
attention span of the viewing audience. The docudrama is a dramatization
of an historical event or lives of real people, using actors or
actresses. Docudramas utilize simulated dialogue, composite characters,
and a telescoping of events occurring over a period into a composite
scene or scenes. This treatment is singularly appropriate and
unexceptionable if the context is not distorted when dealing with public
and political figures.

Self-evidently a docudrama partakes of author's license — it is a
creative interpretation of reality — and if alterations of fact in
scenes portrayed are not made with serious doubts of truth of the
essence of the telescoped composite, such scenes do not ground a charge
of actual malice.

Each scene questioned by the plaintiff is a telescoped composite of
events, personalities, and of the American representatives in Chile who
are involved therein. Each uses permissible literary license to fit
historical detail into a suitable dramatic context. Such dramatic
embellishments as are made do not distort the fundamental story being
told — the frantic search by his family for a missing man who has
suddenly disappeared, their emotions, anxieties, impatience,
frustration, and doubts of assistance from American officialdom. The
scenes are thus a hybrid of fact and fiction which however do not
materially distort the analysis. Always to be remembered is that they
fairly represent the source materials for the film believed to be true
by the filmmakers. Leeway is properly afforded to an author who thus
attempts to recount a true event.

As a matter of law, the dramatic overlay supplied by the film does not
serve to increase the impact of what plaintiff charges as defamatory
since it fairly and reasonably portrays the unassailable beliefs of the
Hormans, the record thereof in the Hauser book, and the corroborative
results of the authors' inquiries. In docudrama, minor fictionalization
cannot be considered evidence or support for the requirement of actual
malice.

The nine scenes selected by plaintiff as support for the requirement of
actual malice do no such thing. Each is related solely and
unquestionably to the theme of this film. The movie's Ray Tower
character is a fictional composite of the American presence operating in
Chile at the time. He is a symbolic figure. The artistic input in the
scenes questioned is found in permissible syntheses and composite
treatment in the film. Although in actuality particular individuals were
not physically present when certain dialogue occurred, in the movie
scene the composite character portrayed was.

The content of the film reflects what happened according to the book,
the persons who complained, and the sources relied on by defendants.
While the actual persons involved in the events portrayed do not appear
in on-scene interviews to describe their experiences, actions, and
motivations, the real names of some individuals are employed. But the
name Ray Davis is never mentioned. Real life personalities are
accordingly represented by telescoped composites in many
instances.

The cases on point demonstrate that the First Amendment protects such
dramatizations and does not demand literal truth in every episode
depicted; publishing a dramatization is not of itself evidence of actual
malice.

In [*Street v. National Broadcasting Co.* (6th Cir.),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4559741824903610057), the
Court of Appeals affirmed a ruling on a directed verdict that the
dramatization embodied in defendant's broadcast program on the
Scottsboro rape trial was protected by the [*New York Times v.
Sullivan*][sullivan] standard, and not chargeable with actual malice. While the dramatization
 contained certain literal falsehoods, including undocumented
statements and conversations &hellip; the movie was based "in all material respects" on the Judge's findings in the Scottsboro case, and a book by a historian documenting the
Scottsboro trial. *Id.* at 1237. 

> Such techniques do not rise to the constitutional level of clear and
> convincing showing of reckless disregard.... [D]eviations from or
> embellishments upon the information obtained from the primary sources
> relied upon were miniscule and can be attributed to the leeway
> afforded an author who attempts to recount and popularize an historic
> event."

[*Hotchner v. Castillo-Puche* (2d Cir. 1977)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15961362284476302575). Defendant published a book which purported to quote derogatory remarks
by Ernest Hemingway about plaintiff. Defendant did not print the literal
words used by Hemingway, and "was fictionalizing to some extent."
[*Hotchner,* 551 F.2d at 914](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15961362284476302575).
The Court of Appeals held that such fictionalization or dramatization
does not satisfy the requirement of clear and convincing evidence from
which a jury might reasonably find that defendant published the alleged
libel with actual malice. Actual malice could not be inferred because
"the change did not increase the defamatory impact or alter the
substantive content" of Hemingway's original statement which defendants
relied upon. *Id.*

#### *Conclusion*

The issue on the motion is not the truth of whether Davis (qua Ray
Tower) ordered or approved a Chilean order to kill Charles Horman
because he "knew too much" about alleged American involvement in the
Chilean coup; the issue is whether the filmmakers intentionally
portrayed such a defamatory suggestion, knowing that it was false or
with serious doubts of its truth. There is no doubt that Ed Horman, the
father of the missing man, asserted such a theory and that assertion is
documented in Hauser's book. Plaintiff has not presented evidence that
defendants knew the theory of the father was false, or entertained
serious doubts as to its truth. There is no evidence that defendants
acted with actual malice or disbelieved what the Hormans thought and
said or what Hauser wrote.

In sum, returning to the *ratio decidendi;* no provable, clear and
convincing, affirmative evidence nor specific facts showing actual
malice on the part of the defendants in publishing the alleged
defamation have been shown, and the complaint by plaintiff, a public
figure, falls as not sustainable under the law.

The complaint is dismissed, with costs.

SO ORDERED.

#### APPENDIX

The plaintiff has designated the following nine scenes in the film
purportedly as the evidence he has that defendants published the film
with actual malice.

##### 1. *Initial Embassy Scene*

The scene depicts a meeting where it is reported that Tower and his
staff have conducted interviews in the area where Charles was last seen.
Tower states he is having dinner with the Junta's chief-of-staff Admiral
Huidobro, implying close connections with the Chilean military, and asks
Beth Horman for a list of Charles' friends which was refused.

Every element in the dramatized scene is traceable to an actual fact
about or statement by Ray Davis derived from Hauser's book. The book
establishes that Ray Davis  was in charge of the American
investigation into Charles Horman's disappearance.

##### 2. *The Hotel Meeting*

The film depicts a meeting at the Hormans' hotel at which Putnam, Clay,
and Tower are present. Clay states that a fingerprint check made at all
the morgues came up negative in the search for Horman's whereabouts and
that Captain Tower checked them himself.

The book describes the fingerprint report by governmental officials, and
this scene is a composite of those who checked on the morgue and the
fingerprints. *Execution* chronicles Ray Davis' statements that he made
inquiries with friends in the Chilean military and was checking "all
possible leads."

##### 3. *The Stadium*

In this scene the language is taken straight from *Execution;* the scene
indicates that Tower and Putnam accompany Ed and Beth Horman to the
National Stadium to search for Charles. American official presence at
the stadium, including the suggestion that Davis was involved in the
investigation into Charles' disappearance, are clearly indicated in
Hauser's account. Indeed, *Execution* portrays that Ray Davis was "in
charge of the investigation."

##### 4. *The Final Embassy Meeting*

In this scene Ed Horman tells Tower and the Embassy officials that he does not think that the military would kill Charles "unless an American official co-signed a kill order" and further indicates that he believes that American officials knew from the start that Charles was dead. These statements by Horman in the film directly reflect his beliefs as described in Hauser's book and as known to the filmmakers.

##### 5. *The Airport Scene*

In this scene Ed Horman tells Putnam, with Tower standing nearby, "I'm
gonna sue you, Phil, and Tower and the Ambassador, and everybody who let
that boy die." While the locale for this confrontation is not placed at
an airport by *Execution,* the speech accurately depicts Ed Horman's
state of mind as described in *Execution.* Horman did sue eleven
government officials.

##### 6. *The Bathroom Scene*

This scene shows Beth Horman in the bathtub at Tower's house when Tower
walks into the bathroom with a drink in his hand. Tower says, "You know,
if I were you, I'd quit living in the past. I think it's about time you
started thinking about your future." Tower exhorts Beth to "stay ahead
of the power curve" as Beth quickly exits the room.

Each of these events is taken almost directly from Hauser's book.
According to Costa-Gavras' affidavit, Joyce Horman told Costa-Gavras
that the book's description of events at Ray Davis's home was actually
understated and overly charitable to Davis, both in describing how much
he had to drink and in detailing precisely what occurred when he entered
her bathroom.

##### 7. *The Meeting with Paris*

In this scene, Paris, described as a desperate former employee of the
Junta, tells Ed Horman that a friend was present and saw Charles
detained at the Ministry of Defense in the office of Chilean General
Lutz, after he was arrested. According to the friend, an American
official was present in the office when the decision was made that the
prisoner "must 'disappear'" because "he knew too much." Paris could not
identify the American official but noted that, "The ministry is full of
them. Their Milgroup office is just down the hall from the General."

This scene is taken directly from Hauser's book, which describes in
detail the allegations of a Chilean defector and former employee of the
Chilean Intelligence Service, Rafael Gonzalez.

##### 8. *The Mafia Speech*

Tower analogizes Charles' death with the murder of someone who becomes
involved with the Mafia. In fact, plaintiff Ray Davis himself made such
a statement and this is documented in *Execution.* Interestingly, these
statements were made by Davis to Thomas Hauser while the latter was
researching his book.

##### 9. *The Telephone Repair Scene*

This scene contains the suggestion that Ed Horman's telephone at his
hotel is wiretapped. A telephone repairman leaves the hotel room and Ed
Horman tells him there was nothing wrong with the phone, and Beth is
portrayed as saying, "hello Ray Tower, how's every little thing."

*Execution* documents the incident with Ed Horman's clear impression
that either the Chilean government or American officials had bugged his
phone.

The next case introduces us to how a state court addresses the question of "life story rights" and celebrity/publicity rights.

JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge:

Prior to 1979, Creig Matthews was an undercover narcotics officer with
the Plano, Texas, police department, in charge of the criminal
investigation division. Kim Wozencraft (Kim Ramsey at the time) was
hired as a police officer. Matthews trained and then worked with her as
an undercover narcotics officer making drug purchases. Both of them used
drugs, primarily marijuana and cocaine, while on the Plano drug
assignment.

In August 1978, Matthews was hired by the Tyler, Texas, police
department as an undercover narcotics officer, where he used the aliases
"Jim" and "Jim Myers." Early the next year, Wozencraft joined him in
Tyler as an undercover drug officer. Together they conducted a drug
investigation that lasted until April 24, 1979. During this time, they
became romantically involved and began living together.

Their primary target in Tyler was Ken Bora, for whom Matthews worked
undercover as a bartender. After several futile attempts to buy drugs
from Bora, Matthews and Wozencraft, on instruction from Tyler police
chief Willie Hardy, made a phony "stash" case on Bora.

During the investigation, Matthews and Wozencraft used drugs both to
make drug cases and for personal use, eventually becoming addicted. They
informed Hardy of Matthews's drug problem. He gave them several days off
but insisted that they continue with the investigation. At the end of
the Tyler investigation, Matthews and Wozencraft assembled over 200 drug
cases, involving the arrest of 100 defendants.

At the conclusion of the investigation, Matthews and Wozencraft were
attacked by a shotgun-wielding assailant at Wozencraft's mobile home.
She returned fire and was not seriously hurt; Matthews was severely
wounded in the arm and leg and was hospitalized for over a month. After
being released from the hospital, Hardy placed them in a house on the
outskirts of Tyler. While there, they were visited by H. Ross Perot, who
at the time was serving as chairman of a special crime commission. Perot
moved them to a secure safe-house in the Dallas area and arranged for
Matthews to receive medical treatment for his wounds.

During this time, Matthews and Wozencraft began testifying at the trials
of some of the drug defendants. They falsely denied using drugs during
the investigation and falsely testified that they had bought cocaine
from Bora.

Evidence arose of their misconduct. Eventually they confessed, pleaded
guilty to criminal informations alleging civil rights violations, and
were sentenced to terms in federal prison.

### The Prison Agreement

While in prison, Wozencraft, Matthews, and fellow inmate John Rubien
signed the contract at issue in this case (the "Prison Agreement").
Matthews and Wozencraft were married at the time the contract was
formed, and Wozencraft is identified in it as "Kimberly Ramsey
Matthews." The contract specifies that Wozencraft and Rubien were to
co-author a book based upon Matthews and Wozencraft's story about the
undercover investigations.

Wozencraft was released from prison in the spring of 1983. She divorced
Matthews and moved to New York City to join Rubien. She already had
started writing the book. She described events in the book, linking them
to specific events that had transpired during the investigations. The
co-authored book by Wozencraft and Rubien was not finished during the
one-year period provided for by the Prison Agreement.

Wozencraft received a masters degree from Columbia University. Her
thesis became the basis for the book entitled RUSH. She sold her
manuscript to Random House and sold the movie rights for one million
dollars.

### Based Upon?

There is substantial evidence that the character "Jim Raynor" in RUSH is based upon Matthews and that the public recognized him as that character. Nonetheless, the book is labeled as a novel and states on its copyright page that it "is a work of fiction. Any resemblance its characters may have to persons living or dead is purely coincidental."

Matthews concedes that the issue raised in RUSH, i.e., corruption of law
enforcement officers, is a matter of public concern. His willingness to
discuss the book with the media has made him a public figure.
Furthermore, prior to the publication of RUSH, Matthews cooperated with
an author named David Ellsworth in publishing SMITH COUNTY JUSTICE, a
non-fiction book detailing Matthews's life and the events surrounding
the Tyler operation.

Matthews has received no compensation for the defendants' use,
portrayal, or promotion of his likeness in the book and movie.

### Appropriation of Life Story?

The district court granted summary judgment on Matthews's appropriation
claim because Texas law does not recognize a cause of action for
appropriation of one's life story and because if it did, there would be
an exception for biographies and "fictionalized biographies." We affirm
the summary judgment.

"One who appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of
another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his
privacy." RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS (the "RESTATEMENT") § 652C
(1977). 

There are three elements to a misappropriation claim under Texas law:

1. that the defendant appropriated the plaintiff's name or likeness for
the value associated with it, and not in an incidental manner or for a
newsworthy purpose;
2. that the plaintiff can be identified from the
publication; and 
3. that there was some advantage or benefit to the defendant. 

*See* [*Faloona v. Hustler Magazine* (5th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1854748454172482731).

Under this test, Matthews is unable to create any issue of material fact
as to liability. There is no question that Matthews can be identified from the
publication, at least to the point of creating a genuine issue of fact
as to the identity of the Jim Raynor character. He claims that his life
story was appropriated for Wozencraft's commercial benefit. The
protection of "name or likeness" under Texas law, however, does not
include a person's life story. If Texas law did protect such a right, it
was not "appropriated." And, even if Matthews could state a claim,
Wozencraft would be protected by an exception in the state tort law.

Tortious liability for appropriation of a name or likeness is intended
to protect the value of an individual's notoriety or skill. Thus, the
RESTATEMENT provides for liability only if:

> the defendant &hellip; appropriated to his own use or benefit the reputation, prestige, social or commercial standing, public interest or other values of the plaintiff's name or likeness.

RESTATEMENT § 652C, comment c. 

The misappropriation tort does not protect one's name *per se;* rather, it protects the value associated with that name.

Appropriation of a name or likeness generally becomes actionable when
used "to advertise the defendant's business or product, or for some
similar commercial purpose." RESTATEMENT § 652C, comment b. The value of
one's likeness is not "appropriated when it is published for purposes
other than taking advantage of his reputation, prestige, or other value
associated with him, for purposes of publicity&hellip; It is only when the
publicity is given for the purpose of appropriating to the defendant's
benefit the commercial or other values associated with the name or the
likeness that the right of privacy is invaded." RESTATEMENT § 652C,
comment d.

There is nothing unique about Matthew's name or likeness that creates
value for Wozencraft to appropriate. She is not "cashing-in" on goodwill
associated with his name but is simply converting factual events that
happen to include Matthews into fiction. The use of his name does not
provide value to the book, nor is she using his name to "endorse" the
book to the public, because his name has no independent value. In short,
Matthew's life story, while interesting to readers and film-goers, is
not a "name or likeness" for purposes of applying the misappropriation
doctrine.

Protecting one's name or likeness from misappropriation is socially
beneficial because it encourages people to develop special skills, which
then can be used for commercial advantage. Associating one's goodwill
with a product transmits valuable information to consumers. Without the
artificial scarcity created by the protection of one's likeness, that
likeness would be exploited  commercially until the marginal
value of its use is zero.

For instance, if a well-known public figure's picture could be used
freely to endorse commercial products, the value of his likeness would
disappear. Creating artificial scarcity preserves the value to him, to
advertisers who contract for the use of his likeness, and in the end, to
consumers, who receive information from the knowledge that he is being
paid to endorse the product. *See* [*Kimbrough v. Coca-Cola* (Tex.Civ.App. 1975](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2288203517052278533) (in which former Texas A & M football star stated valid claim for misappropriation where his picture was used, over his objection, as part of an advertisement for Coca-Cola in a football game program).

As Judge Posner writes,

> It might seem that creating a property right in such uses would not
> lead to any socially worthwhile investment but would simply enrich
> already wealthy celebrities. However, whatever information value a
> celebrity's endorsement has to consumers will be lost if every
> advertiser can use the celebrity's name and picture.&hellip; [T]he value of
> associating the celebrity's name with a particular product will be
> diminished if others are permitted to use the name in association with
> their products.

RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW § 3.3, at 43 (4th ed. 1992).

The tort of misappropriation of name or likeness, therefore, creates
property rights only where the failure to do so would result in the
excessive exploitation of its value.

[Thus, the term "likeness" includes such things as pictures, drawings, and the use of a singer's distinctive voice.]

The term "likeness" does not include general incidents from a person's
life, especially when fictionalized. The narrative of an
individual's life, standing alone, lacks the value of a name or likeness
that the misappropriation tort protects. Unlike the goodwill associated
with one's name or likeness, the facts of an individual's life possess
no intrinsic value that will deteriorate with repeated use. As Posner
observes, "If Brand X beer makes money using Celebrity A's 
picture in its advertising, competing brands might use the same picture
until the picture ceased to have any advertising value at all. In
contrast, the multiple use of a celebrity's photograph by competing
newspapers is unlikely to reduce the value of the photograph to the
newspaper-reading public." RICHARD A. POSNER, THE ECONOMICS OF JUSTICE
258 (2d ed. 1983).

Far from reducing the value of Matthews's story, RUSH increased the
value, as reflected in the publication of articles about Matthews and
Wozencraft in NEW YORK MAGAZINE, THE WASHINGTON POST, and THE GUARDIAN,
among others. Similarly, SMITH COUNTY JUSTICE, although published first,
did not reduce the sales of RUSH. As there is no fear that any valuable
information provided by the facts of one's life will be reduced by
repeated use, the law does not forbid the "appropriation" of this
information.

Further, because most of the material facts are a matter of public
record because of the highly-publicized trial, it is especially
difficult for Matthews to claim that his likeness was unfairly
appropriated, as a name cannot be appropriated by reference to it in
connection with the legitimate mention of public activities. 

### III.

#### A.

Even if Texas courts recognized a cause of action for misappropriation
of events in one's life, it likely would recognize an exception for
biographies. As one commentator has written, "Courts long ago recognized
that a celebrity's right of publicity does not preclude others from
incorporating a person's name, features or biography in a literary work,
motion picture, news or entertainment story. Only the use of an
individual's identity in advertising infringes on the persona." George
M. Armstrong, Jr., *The Reification of Celebrity: Persona as Property,*
51 LA. L.REV. 443, 467 (1991) (citing [*Rogers v. Grimaldi* (SDNY 1988),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6586536591928416222) *aff'd,* [875 F.2d 994 (2d
Cir.1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849&q=matthews+wozencraft&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)).

#### B.

Matthews also contends that appropriation can occur through the
fictionalized account of his life. The cases he cites, however, do not support his argument, as they apply the "false light" doctrine. In each of them, (1) the plaintiff's real name was used; (2) false or defamatory statements were made regarding the plaintiff; and (3) the plaintiff alleged invasion of privacy by false light, not misappropriation.

By contrast, RUSH does not use Matthews's real name, and Matthews admits
that all the material facts are true. Thus, assuming he is trying to
state a claim under the false light doctrine, rather than
misappropriation, his attempt fails.

#### C.

Even if Matthews has created a genuine issue of material fact on his misappropriation claim, Wozencraft is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because of free speech and public domain defenses. 

#####  1.

While there is no binding authority directly on point, we conclude that
Wozencraft's novel falls within the protection of the First Amendment.
It is immaterial whether RUSH "is viewed as an historical or a fictional
work," [*Meeropol v. Nizer* (2d Cir.1977),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15243536244801528103&q=matthews+wozencraft&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) so long as it is not "simply a disguised commercial advertisement for
the sale of goods or services." [*Rogers v. Grimaldi* (2d Cir. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849).

The book and its accompanying publicity have converted Matthews into a
public figure under [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1974)][gertz] 
"[T]he same standards of constitutional protection apply to an invasion
of privacy as to libel actions." [*Meeropol*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15243536244801528103).

Accordingly, absent a showing of malice, i.e., a "reckless disregard for
the truth," RUSH is protected by the First Amendment. *See* [*Time, Inc.
v. Hill* (S.Ct. 1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13178370409068522665).
Neither the book nor the movie holds out Matthews in a false light or in
an embarrassing way; thus, his claim is meritless.

##### 2.

Liability for misappropriation also will not arise when the information
in question is in the public domain, for the public figure no longer has
the right to control the dissemination of the information. *See*
[*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine* (7th Cir.1985),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17887957795289404111). 

"To whatever degree and whatever connection a man's life ceases to be
private before the publication under consideration has been made, to
that extent the protection is withdrawn.&hellip;" Samuel D. Warren & Louis D.
Brandeis, *The Right to Privacy,* 4 HARV.L.REV. 193, 214-15 (1890). As
one court has commented,

> [A] public figure has no exclusive rights to his or her own life
> story.&hellip; Such life story of the public figure may legitimately
> extend, to some reasonable degree, to &hellip; information concerning the
> individual, and to facts about him, which are not public.&hellip; Thus the
> life history of one accused of [crime], together with such heretofore
> private facts may throw some light upon what kind of person he is, his
> possible guilt or innocence, or his reasons for committing a crime,
> are a matter of legitimate public interest.

[*Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Co.* (PA 1971)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9993111382594898727).

In the time since his participation in the Tyler drug investigation and
his subsequent conviction and prison time for his illegal activity,
Matthews voluntarily submitted to numerous interviews with the national
media. He also cooperated in the publication of SMITH COUNTY JUSTICE and
testified about his activities in Hardy's criminal trial. All the
material facts underlying RUSH were a matter of public knowledge and
were in the public domain.

Thus, Matthews became a public figure through his activities. The
subject matter of his statements — narcotics officers using drugs,
perjuring themselves, and making fraudulent charges — was a matter of
public interest. *See* [*Trotter v. Jack Anderson Enters.* (5th
Cir. 1987)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7863481418724943576).

Because all of the events were a part of the public domain, defendants
were entitled to  their fair use, including their narration in
fictionalized form. [*Douglass*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17887957795289404111).

[The court's discussion of contract matters and division of marital property omitted.]

####  VI.

Matthews has created no genuine issue of material fact under Texas law.
Thus, we AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment on all
claims.

OF TORTS § 117 at 853 (5th ed. 1984) ("Nor is there any liability [for
misappropriation] when the plaintiff's character, occupation and the
general outline of his career, with many incidents in his life, are used
as the basis for a figure in a novel who is still clearly a fictional
one.")

## Privacy Rights 

### Invasion of Privacy

Privacy rights come in four different flavors, best described by Justice Louis Brandeis in a famous [1890 Harvard Law Review article][brandeis_article] as "the right to be left alone." 

1. Intrusion - Unreasonable intrusion on personal solitude.
2. Publication of Private Facts - Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.
3. False Light - Presentation of people in a false light in the public eye.
4. Celebrity Publicity Rights - Appropriation of one's name, image, or likeness.

* [If Only J-Law Could Retain Brandeis](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-05/if-only-j-law-could-retain-brandeis?alcmpid=view).

#### 1. Intrusion Upon Seclusion

> One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652B: Intrusion upon Seclusion](http://tinyurl.com/lqqgzng)

#### 2. Publication of Private Facts

###### aka Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that:

> (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652D: Publicity Given to Private Life](http://tinyurl.com/njkdaxt)

#### 3. False Light

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if:

> (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652E: Publicity Placing Person in False Light](http://tinyurl.com/lbhzrf5)

False light is a close cousin to defamation, and the two torts are often pled together. In [*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=769+F.2d+1128&appflag=67.12) (7th Cir 1985), Judge Richard Posner explained the difference this way:

> The false-light tort, to the extent distinct from the tort of defamation (but there is indeed considerable overlap), rests on an awareness that people who are made to seem pathetic or ridiculous may be shunned, and not just people who are thought to be dishonest or incompetent or
immoral. 

Defamation focuses on the damage to the plaintiff’s reputation in the community, while false light privacy concentrates on the psychological harm done to the plaintiff from objectionable misrepresentations.

A medical news team (with a private paramedic and a ride-along cameraman) covered a car crash in which Ruth Shulman was gravely injured. The news team filmed the scene and put a mic on a nurse, who went into the helicopter where Ruth Shulman was being treated for her injuries.

The accident turned Ruth Shulman into a paraplegic. The news team videotaped her saying things like, "I just want to die. I don’t want to go through with this." Shulman was in a state of shock at the accident scene, so she did not recall that her statements were videotaped and recorded.

Three months after the accident, Ruth Shulman watched herself on *On Scene: Emergency Response*, a reality news show. The producers did not use her last name, but Shulman was upset that her comments and images of her were enhanced, and then aired on national television – without her permission. 

Ruth Shulman sued for invasion of privacy. Her case was dismissed when the Superior Court ruled that the media had a First Amendment right to videotape and broadcast the sights and sounds of her ordeal. 

Shulman then appealed to the California Supreme Court. In an important decision for the right of privacy, the Supreme Court found for Ruth Shulman by ruling that the reality TV show producers intruded on Ruth Shulman's right of privacy at the scene of the highway accident by filming and recording her ordeal without her permission.

POSNER, Chief Judge.

Luther Haynes and his wife, Dorothy Haynes née Johnson, appeal from the
dismissal on the defendants' motion for summary judgment of their suit
against Nicholas Lemann, the author of a highly praised, best-selling
book of social and political history called *The Promised Land: The
Great Black Migration and How It Changed America* (1991), and Alfred A.
Knopf, Inc., the book's publisher. The plaintiffs claim that the book
libels Luther Haynes and invades both plaintiffs' right of privacy.
Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity, and the common law of
Illinois is agreed to govern the substantive issues. The appeal presents
difficult issues at the intersection of tort law and freedom of the
press.

Between 1940 and 1970, five million blacks moved from impoverished rural
areas in the South to the cities of the North in search of a better
life. Some found it, and after sojourns of shorter or greater length in
the poor black districts of the cities moved to middle-class areas.
Others, despite the ballyhooed efforts of the federal government,
particularly between 1964 and 1972, to erase poverty and racial
discrimination, remained mired in what has come to be called the "urban
ghetto." *The Promised Land* is a history of the migration. It is not
history as a professional historian, a demographer, or a social
scientist would write it. Lemann is none of these. He is a journalist
and has written a journalistic history, in which the focus is on
individuals whether powerful or representative. In the former group are
the politicians who invented, executed, or exploited the "Great Society"
programs. In the latter are a handful of the actual migrants. Foremost
among these is Ruby Lee Daniels. Her story is the spine of the book. We
are introduced to her on page 7; we take leave of her on page 346,
within a few pages of the end of the text of the book.

When we meet her, it is the early 1940s and she is a young woman picking
cotton on a plantation in Clarksdale, Mississippi. "[B]lack sharecropper
society on the eve of the introduction [in the 1940s] of the mechanical
cotton picker [a major spur to the migration] was the equivalent of
big-city ghetto society today in many ways. It was the national center
of illegitimate childbearing and of the female-headed family." Ruby had
married young, but after her husband had been inducted into the army on
the eve of World War II she had fallen in love with a married man, by
whom she had had a child. The man's wife died and Ruby married him, but
they broke up after a month. Glowing reports from an aunt who had moved
to Chicago persuaded Ruby Daniels to move there in 1946. She found a job
doing janitorial work, but eventually lost the job and went on public
aid. She was unmarried, and had several children, when in 1953 she met
"the most important man in her life." Luther Haynes, born in 1924 or
1925, a sharecropper from Mississippi, had moved to Chicago in an effort
to effect a reconciliation with his wife. The effort had failed. When he
met Ruby Daniels he had a well-paying job in an awning factory. They
lived together, and had children. But then "Luther began to drink too
much. When he drank he got mean, and he and Ruby would get into
ferocious quarrels. He was still working, but he wasn't always bringing
his paycheck home." Ruby got work as a maid. They moved to a poorer part
of the city. The relationship went downhill. "It got to the point where
[Luther] would go out on Friday evenings after picking up his paycheck,
and Ruby would hope he wouldn't come home, because she knew he would be
drunk. On the Friday evenings when he did come home — over the years
Ruby developed a devastating  imitation of Luther, and could
recreate the scene quite vividly — he would walk into the apartment, put
on a record and turn up the volume, and saunter into their bedroom, a
bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other, in the mood for love.
On one such night, Ruby's last child, Kevin, was conceived. Kevin always
had something wrong with him — he was very moody, he was scrawny, and he
had a severe speech impediment. Ruby was never able to find out exactly
what the problem was, but she blamed it on Luther; all that alcohol must
have gotten into his sperm, she said."

Ruby was on public aid, but was cut off when social workers discovered
she had a man in the house. She got a night job. Luther was supposed to
stay with the children while she was at work, especially since they
lived in a dangerous neighborhood; but often when she came home, at 3:00
a.m. or so, she would "find the older children awake, and when she would
ask them if Luther had been there, the answer would be, 'No, ma'am.'"
Ruby's last aid check, arriving providentially after she had been cut
off, enabled the couple to buy a modest house on contract — it "was, by
a wide margin, the best place she had ever lived." But "after only a few
months, Luther ruined everything by going out and buying a brand-new
1961 Pontiac. It meant more to him than the house did, and when they
couldn't make the house payment, he insisted on keeping the car" even
though she hadn't enough money to buy shoes for the children. The family
was kicked out of the house. They now moved frequently. They were
reaching rock bottom. At this nadir, hope appeared in the ironic form of
the Robert Taylor Homes, then a brand-new public housing project, now a
notorious focus of drug addiction and gang violence. Ruby had had an
application for public housing on file for many years, but the housing
authority screened out unwed mothers. Told by a social worker that she
could have an apartment in the Taylor Homes if she produced a marriage
license, she and Luther (who was now divorced from his first wife) were
married forthwith and promptly accepted as tenants. "The Haynes family
chose to rejoice in their good fortune in becoming residents of the
Robert Taylor Homes. As Ruby's son Larry, who was twelve years old at
the time, says, 'I thought that was the beautifullest place in the
world.'"

Even in the halcyon days of 1962, the Robert Taylor Homes were no
paradise. There was considerable crime, and there were gangs, and Ruby's
son Kermit joined one. Kermit was not Luther's son and did not recognize
his authority. The two quarreled a lot. Meanwhile Luther had lost his
job in the awning factory "that he had had for a decade, and then
bounced around a little. He lost jobs because of transportation
problems, because of layoffs, because of a bout of serious illness,
because of his drinking, because he had a minor criminal record (having
been in jail for disorderly conduct following a fight with Ruby), and
because creditors were after him." He resumed "his old habit of not
returning from work on Fridays after he got his paycheck." One weekend
he didn't come home at all. In a search of his things Ruby discovered
evidence that Luther was having an affair with Dorothy Johnson, a former
neighbor. "Luther was not being particularly careful; he saw in Dorothy,
who was younger than Ruby, who had three children compared to Ruby's
eight, who had a job while Ruby was on public aid, the promise of an
escape from the ghetto, and he was entranced." The children discovered
the affair. Kermit tried to strangle Luther. In 1965 Luther moved out
permanently, and eventually he and Ruby divorced.

Ruby remained in the Robert Taylor Homes until 1979, when she moved back
to Clarksdale. She had become eligible for social security in 1978; and
with her surviving children (one of her sons had died, either a suicide
or murdered) now adults, though most of them deeply troubled adults and
Kevin, whom Ruby in a custody proceeding described as retarded, still
living at home, Ruby "is settling into old age with a sense of
contentment about the circumstances she has found." But "there has
always been that nagging sensation of incompleteness, which made itself
felt most directly in her relationships with men."

 After divorcing Ruby, Luther Haynes married Dorothy Johnson.
He is still married to her, "owns a home on the far South Side of
Chicago, and has worked for years as a parking-lot attendant; only
recently have he and Ruby found that they can speak civilly to each
other on the phone."

There is much more to the book than our paraphrase and excerpts—much
about other migrants, about the travails of Ruby's children, about
discrimination against blacks in both the North and the South, and about
the politics of poverty programs in Washington and Chicago. But the
excerpts we have quoted contain all the passages upon which the
Hayneses' lawsuit is founded.

### Defamation

The charge of libel is confined to three statements in the book: that Haynes left his children alone at night when he was supposed to be watching them; that he lost a job or jobs because of drinking; and that he spent money on a car that he should have used to buy shoes for his children. We do not agree with the defendants that the dismissal of the libel claim must be upheld because Haynes has failed to allege pecuniary loss from the alleged libels ("special damages"). The rule in Illinois, which used to be limited to slander cases but has been extended to all defamation cases, [*Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson* (7th Cir.1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2482630921714735229) is that a plaintiff can maintain a suit for defamation without proof of special damages only if the defamatory statement falls into one of four "per se" categories: commission of a crime; infection with a type of communicable disease that could cause the infected person to be shunned; malfeasance or misfeasance in the performance of an office or a job; and (what is closely related, but less redolent of actual misconduct and usable by business firms as well as by workers or professionals) unfitness for one's profession or trade. *Id.* at 267-68; [*Mittelman v.  Witous* (Ill. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13391763345781536115).  The statements that Haynes claims are libelous can be interpreted, though just barely, as implying that he was guilty of criminal neglect of his children and was unable to discharge the duties of at least one of his jobs because of alcohol. Ever since modification of the "innocent construction" doctrine in [*Chapski v. Copley Press* (Ill. 1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13218046548992207255) which left the doctrine meaning merely that a court should not strain to put a defamatory interpretation on an ambiguous statement, Illinois courts (and federal courts when interpreting Illinois law) have
been quick to find implications of criminal conduct or of employee or
business misconduct in statements that might have seemed susceptible of
an interpretation that would have taken them out of the per se
categories. See [*Babb v. Minder* (7th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3037575594865725968) (statement that employee had "mooned" held actionable as an accusation
of the crime of indecent exposure); [*Costello v. Capital Cities
Communications, Inc.* (Ill. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2262435237814463228)
(statement that employee had lied held actionable as implying lack of
integrity in performance of duties); 
[*Crinkley v. Dow Jones & Co.*(Ill.App.3d 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10602561162619040127&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(statement alleging payoffs to agents of foreign governments held
actionable); [*Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson* (7th Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2482630921714735229)
(allegations that cigarette company attempted through its advertising to
entice children to smoke held actionable).

The requirement of proving special damages does prevent Haynes from
basing a libel claim on two other statements in the book that he
contends are false: that his drinking was responsible for Kevin's
defects and that his motives for leaving Ruby for Dorothy were
financial. (The second is an implication rather than an outright
statement, but we shall give Haynes the benefit of the doubt and assume
with him that the book implies that his motives were financial rather
than—an interpretation that the passage also supports, and that the
innocent-construction rule, even in its tempered form after *Chapski,*
might therefore require be placed on it — a more diffuse hope of
betterment.) These statements are not within any of the per se
categories and therefore are not actionable, because Haynes alleges no
pecuniary injury.  They probably would be nonactionable in any
event as obvious statements of opinion (Ruby's and Lemann's
respectively) rather than of fact. A statement of fact is not shielded
from an action for defamation by being prefaced with the words "in my
opinion," but if it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective
view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise, rather than
claiming to be in possession of objectively verifiable facts, the
statement is not actionable. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.* (S.Ct. 1990)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7582860956470530700);

The facts about Kevin's condition and about the respective financial
circumstances of Ruby and Dorothy were uncontested, and Ruby and Lemann
were entitled to their interpretation of them. Luther drank heavily; the
proposition that a man's heavy drinking can, and that Luther's heavy
drinking did, damage a fetus is represented in the book merely as Ruby's
conjecture. A reasonable reader would not suppose that she had proof, or
even the scientific knowledge that might ground a reasonable inference.
As for Luther's motives for leaving Ruby for Dorothy, they can never be
known for sure (even by Luther) and anyone is entitled to speculate on a
person's motives from the known facts of his behavior. Luther Haynes
left a poor woman for a less poor one, and Lemann drew a natural though
not inevitable inference. He did not pretend to have the inside dope. He
and Ruby claim insight, not information that the plaintiff might be able
to prove false in a trial.

Lemann's source for the only statements upon which Luther Haynes can
base his claim for defamation, as for most of the rest of what he wrote
about Haynes, was Ruby Daniels. He had interviewed Haynes as well, but
Haynes in his deposition denied that Lemann had questioned him about his
relationship with Ruby. Haynes swears that he never left his children
alone in a dangerous neighborhood when he was supposed to be with them,
did not by his expenditures on the Pontiac deprive his children of
shoes, and was fired not for drinking but because he had been given a
bottle of liquor by a friend which was found unopened in his pocket by
his supervisor; since his job was that of an armed security guard, the
supervisor was unwilling to take a chance on the truthfulness of his
story. Haynes's version of how he lost a job because of "drinking" is
corroborated by Lemann's notes of his interview with Haynes, but is not
mentioned in the book.

It would take a trial to decide whether Ruby Daniels (and hence Nicholas
Lemann) or Luther Haynes should be believed on these three matters. But
the district judge was nevertheless correct to dismiss the defamation
claim because if the gist of a defamatory statement is true, if in other
words the statement is substantially true, error in detail is not
actionable (citations omitted). 

To evaluate the application of this rule to Haynes's libel claims
requires us to consider facts brought out in discovery and not
contested, although they are not in the book. Haynes in his deposition
admitted to drinking heavily during the period when he lost his job
because of the unopened liquor bottle in his pocket. He admitted to
being arrested and jailed for assaulting a police officer after
drinking. When he walked out on Ruby he also walked out on his four
children by her, and he refused to support  them. She was
forced to obtain court orders for child support. Haynes repeatedly
flouted the orders and eventually was jailed for contempt. During their
divorce proceedings it came out that, after leaving Ruby, he and Dorothy
Johnson had had a marriage ceremony and he had entered their names in
the marriage registry of the county clerk's office —two years before his
divorce from Ruby.

Beside these uncontested facts — not to mention the facts about Haynes
in the book that he does not contend are false — the alleged falsehoods
pale. They do not exhibit him in a worse light than a bare recitation of
the uncontested facts about his behavior in relation to Ruby and her
children would do. For Lemann left out much that was true. He did not
mention the bigamous marriage, the repeated flouting of child-support
orders, the arrest for assaulting a police officer, or the jailing for
contempt. Substitute the true for the false (if Haynes is believed), and
the damage to Haynes's reputation would be no less.

The rule of substantial truth is based on a recognition that falsehoods
which do no *incremental* damage to the plaintiff's reputation do not
injure the only interest that the law of defamation protects. A news
report that contains a false statement is actionable "only when
'significantly greater opprobrium' results from the report containing
the falsehood than would result from the report without the falsehood."
[*Herron v. King Broadcasting Co., supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17202290302354597366).
Even when the plaintiff in a defamation suit is not a public figure, the
Supreme Court insists in the name of the First Amendment that unless the
author is deliberately lying or is recklessly indifferent to the truth
or falsity of what he says (neither is a plausible hypothesis here), the
plaintiff must prove actual though not necessarily pecuniary harm in
order to recover damages. [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202).
Falsehoods that do not harm the plaintiff's reputation more than a full
recital of the true facts about him would do are thus not actionable.
The rule making substantial truth a complete defense and the
constitutional limitations on defamation suits coincide.

Ordinarily the question whether a defamatory work is substantially true
although erroneous in some details is for the jury. [*Kohn v. West
Hawaii Today, Inc.,* (HW 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18205638400160040600).
But no reasonable jury, even if it believed Luther Haynes over Ruby
Daniels on every issue on which they differ, could find that *The
Promised Land* was not substantially true in its depiction of Luther at
the time he lived with Ruby. He *was* a heavy drinker, a bad husband, a
bad father, an erratic employee. These are things either that he
concedes or that are incontestably established by the judicial records
in his matrimonial litigation. Whether he left the children alone at
night on some occasions when Ruby was working, or was fired for drinking
rather than for having liquor on his person while working, or preferred
to spend money on his car than on his children's shoes, are details
that, while not trivial, would not if corrected have altered the picture
that the true facts paint. And it makes no difference that the true
facts were unknown until the trial. A person does not have a legally
protected right to a reputation based on the concealment of the truth.
This is implicit in the rule that truth — not just known truth (see
*Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 581A, comment h (1977); *Prosser and
Keeton on the Law of Torts* § 116, at pp. 840-41 (5th ed. 1984)) — is a
complete defense to defamation. And the burden of proving falsity rests
on the plaintiff. [*Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps* (S.Ct. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3066699330828671613) 

We must be careful, however, that we are not construing the gist of the
allegedly defamatory statements so broadly as to invite defendants to
commit, in effect, a further but privileged libel, by bringing to light
every discreditable act that the plaintiff may have committed, in an
effort to show that he is as "bad" as the defamatory statements depict
him. This would strip people who had done bad things of any legal
protection against being defamed; they would be defamation outlaws. The
true damaging facts must be closely related to the false ones. But that
 test is satisfied. Luther abandoned his children and was
eventually jailed for doing so. These truths encompass and transcend
what, whether or not it might be elevated to criminal neglect, is, after
all, common enough — leaving children, some of them teenagers,
unattended late at night. (And how different is that from leaving a
child at night with a teenage babysitter?) An armed security guard who
is discovered by his employer to have a bottle of liquor in his pocket
is equivalent in irresponsible employee conduct to an ordinary worker
found drinking on the job. And a decision to spend money on a car rather
than on one's children's clothes is subsumed by total financial
abandonment of one's children in violation of court orders, an
abandonment compounded by a bigamous marriage to a woman who herself had
children. The allegedly false facts about Luther were variants of the
true that did not paint him in a worse light. Corresponding to the
"immaterial error[s]" of which the substantial-truth cases speak,
[*Sivulich v. Howard Publications, Inc.,* 126 Ill.App.3d 129, 81 Ill.
Dec. 416, 418, 466 N.E.2d 1218, 1220
(1984),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15779388720675284227&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the alleged falsehoods were merely illustrations of undoubted truths
about Luther Haynes's character at the time, illustrations that even if
false in detail conveyed an accurate impression. They were therefore
substantially true within the meaning which this term must bear to make
sense of the cases.

### Invasion of Privacy

The major claim in the complaint, and the focus of the appeal, is not
defamation, however; it is invasion of the right of privacy. In tort law
the term "right of privacy" covers several distinct wrongs. Using a
celebrity's (or other person's) name or picture in advertising without
his consent. [*Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc.,* (6th
Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18021528625868373370);
[*Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Social Change, Inc. v. American
Heritage Products, Inc.,* (GA 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1102676940012657150);
[*Haelan Laboratories v. Topps Chewing Gum* (2d Cir. 1953)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18211552832825571674);
[*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.* (7th Cir. 1985)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17887957795289404111).
Tapping someone's phone, or otherwise invading a person's private space.
[*De May v. Roberts* (MI 1881)] (many citations omitted); 

Harassing a celebrity by following her too closely, albeit on a public street. Cf. [*Galella v. Onassis* (2d Cir. 1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1876391558280554729). Casting a person in a false light by publicizing details of the person's life that while true are so selected or highlighted as to convey a misleading impression of the person's character. [*Time, Inc. v. Hill* (S.Ct. 1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13178370409068522665).  Publicizing personal facts that while true and not misleading are so intimate that their disclosure to the public is deeply embarrassing to the person thus exposed and is perceived as gratuitous by the community (many citations omitted).

The last, the publicizing of personal facts, is the aspect of invasion of privacy charged by the Hayneses.

Even people who have nothing rationally to be ashamed of can be
mortified by the publication of intimate details of their life. Most
people in no wise deformed or disfigured would nevertheless be deeply
upset if nude photographs of themselves were published in a newspaper or
a book. They feel the same way about photographs of their sexual
activities, however "normal," or about a narrative of those activities,
or about having their medical records publicized. Although it is well
known that every human being defecates, no adult human being in our
society wants a newspaper to show a picture of him defecating. The
desire for privacy illustrated by these examples is a mysterious but
deep fact about human personality. It deserves and in our society
receives legal protection. The nature of the injury shows, by the way,
that the defendants are wrong to argue that this branch of the right of
privacy requires proof of special damages. 

But this is not the character of the depictions of the Hayneses in *The
Promised Land.* Although the plaintiff's claim that the book depicts
their "sex life" and "ridicules" Luther Haynes's lovemaking (the
reference is to the passage we quoted in which the author refers to
Ruby's "devastating imitation" of Luther's manner when he would come
home Friday nights in an amorous mood), these characterizations are
misleading. No sexual act is described in the book. No intimate details
are revealed. Entering one's bedroom with a bottle in one hand and a
cigarette in the other is not foreplay. Ruby's speculation that Kevin's
problems may have been due to Luther's having been a heavy drinker is
not the narration of a sexual act.

We said that proof of special damages is not required in a case in which
the public revelation of personal facts is claimed to be an invasion of
privacy. Even so, a plaintiff is not allowed to evade the rule that
requires proof of such damages in defamation cases (outside the per se
categories) by attempting to prove that some of the personal facts
publicized about him are false, unless he is prepared to prove special
damages — and perhaps, as we are about to see, there is no "unless."
Haynes denies that his drinking had anything to do with his son Kevin's
defects or that he was actuated by mercenary considerations in leaving
Ruby for Dorothy. These denials, we have seen, could not be made the
basis of a libel case in the absence of proof of special damages, here
lacking. No more, we think, can they be used to enhance a privacy case,
whether it is a false-light case, [*Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v.
Jacobson, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2482630921714735229)

See generally [*Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra,* § 652E, comment e.](http://tinyurl.com/lbhzrf5) Indeed, that type of case presupposes the truth of the facts disclosed.
*Id.* If they are false, the interest invaded is that protected by the
defamation and false-light torts: the interest in being represented
truthfully to the world.

Absence of special damages may be the reason why the Hayneses have not
appealed the dismissal of their claim that the defendants cast Luther in
a false light — though in fairness to him we should point out that they
may have placed him in a false light with respect to his motives for
leaving Ruby. Lemann's interview notes suggest (as the book does not, at
least not clearly) that the major difference which Haynes perceived
between the two women was one of character rather than of financial
wherewithal. According to the notes, Haynes told Lemann that Ruby "never
wanted to work. She wanted to sit around and be on aid. I called Ruby
and asked her why she let 'Nita [their daughter] have a baby and she
said, She's grown. I couldn't handle that talk, so I said forget it.
Ruby was on aid when I met her, and she wanted to have more kids so she
could have more aid. Dorothy had three kids, and a job."

This is an aside. The branch of privacy law that the Hayneses invoke in
their appeal is not concerned with, and is not a proper surrogate for
legal doctrines that are concerned with, the accuracy of the private
facts revealed. It is concerned with the propriety of stripping away the
veil of privacy with which we cover the embarrassing, the shameful, the
tabooed, truths about us. [*Leidholdt v. L.F.P. Inc., supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15529001075929717432).
The revelations in the book are not about the intimate details of the
Hayneses' life. They are about misconduct, in particular Luther's.
(There is very little about Dorothy in the book, apart from the fact
that she had had an affair with Luther while he was still married to
Ruby and that they eventually became and have remained lawfully
married.) The revelations are about his heavy drinking, his unstable
employment, his adultery, his irresponsible and neglectful behavior
toward his wife and children. So we must consider cases in which the
right of privacy has been invoked as a shield against the revelation of
previous misconduct.

 Two early cases illustrate the range of judicial thinking. In
[*Melvin v. Reid,* 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 Pac. 91
(1931),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the plaintiff was a former prostitute, who had been prosecuted but
acquitted of murder. She later had married and (she alleged) for seven
years had lived a blameless respectable life in a community in which her
lurid past was unknown — when all was revealed in a movie about the
murder case which used her maiden name. The court held that these
allegations stated a claim for invasion of privacy. The Hayneses' claim
is similar although less dramatic. They have been a respectable married
couple for two decades. Luther's alcohol problem is behind him. He has
steady employment as a doorman. His wife is a nurse, and in 1990 he told
Lemann that the couple's combined income was $60,000 a year. He is not
in trouble with the domestic relations court. He is a deacon of his
church. He has come a long way from sharecropping in Mississippi and
public housing in Chicago and he and his wife want to bury their past
just as Mrs. Melvin wanted to do and in [*Melvin v.
Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) was held entitled to do. 

In Luther Haynes's own words, from his deposition, "I know I haven't
been no angel, but since almost 30 years ago I have turned my life
completely around. I stopped the drinking and all this bad habits and
stuff like that, which I deny, some of [it] I didn't deny, because I
have changed my life. It take me almost 30 years to change it and I am
deeply in my church. I look good in the eyes of my church members and my
community. Now, what is going to happen now when this public reads this
garbage which I didn't tell Mr. Lemann to write? Then all this is going
to go down the drain. And I worked like a son of a gun to build myself
up in a good reputation and he has torn it down."

But with [*Melvin v.
Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
compare [*Sidis v. F-R Publishing Corp.,* 113 F.2d 806 (2d Cir.
1940),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14505170794897587048&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
another old case but one more consonant with modern thinking about the
proper balance between the right of privacy and the freedom of the
press. A child prodigy had flamed out; he was now an eccentric recluse.
The *New Yorker* ran a "where is he now" article about him. The article,
entitled "April Fool," did not reveal any misconduct by Sidis but it
depicted him in mocking tones as a comical failure, in much the same way
that the report of Ruby's "devastating imitation" of the amorous Luther
Haynes could be thought to have depicted him as a comical failure,
albeit with sinister consequences absent from Sidis's case. The invasion
of Sidis's privacy was palpable. But the publisher won. No intimate
physical details of Sidis's life had been revealed; and on the other
side was the undoubted newsworthiness of a child prodigy, as of a woman
prosecuted for murder. Sidis, unlike Mrs. Melvin, was not permitted to
bury his past.

Evolution along the divergent lines marked out by *Melvin* and *Sidis*
continued &hellip; until [*Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn* (S.Ct. 1975),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7693360934058091897)
which may have consigned the entire *Melvin* line to the outer darkness.
A Georgia statute forbade the publication of names of rape victims. A
television station obtained the name of a woman who had been raped and
murdered from the indictment of her assailants (a public document), and
broadcast it in defiance of the statute. The woman's father brought a
tort suit against the broadcaster, claiming that the broadcast had
violated his right of privacy. The broadcaster argued that the name of
the woman was a matter of public concern, but the Georgia supreme court
held that the statute established the contrary, and affirmed a finding
of liability. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute
violated the First Amendment. The Court declined to rule whether the
publication of truthful information can ever be made the basis of a tort
suit for invasion of privacy, but held that the First Amendment creates
a privilege to publish matters contained in public records even
 if publication would offend the sensibilities of a reasonable
person. Years later the Court extended the rule laid down in *Cox* to a
case in which a newspaper published a rape victim's name (again in
violation of a state statute) that it had obtained from a police report
that was not a public document. [*Florida Star v. B.J.F.* (S.Ct. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11083261902857685106).
Again the Court was careful not to hold that states can never provide a
tort remedy to a person about whom truthful, but intensely private,
information of some interest to the public is published. 

We do not think the Court was being coy in *Cox* or *Florida Star* in
declining to declare the tort of publicizing intensely personal facts
totally defunct. (Indeed, the author of *Cox* dissented in *Florida
Star.*) The publication of facts in a public record or other official
document, such as the police report in the *Florida Star,* is not to be
equated to publishing a photo of a couple making love or of a person
undergoing some intimate medical procedure; we even doubt that it would
make a difference in such a case if the photograph had been printed in a
government document (say the patient's file in a Veterans Administration
hospital).

Yet despite the limited scope of the holdings of *Cox* and *Florida
Star,* the implications of those decisions for the branch of the right
of privacy that limits the publication of private facts are profound,
even for a case such as this in which, unlike [*Melvin v.
Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*,*
the primary source of the allegedly humiliating personal facts is not a
public record. (The primary source is Ruby Daniels.) The Court must
believe that the First Amendment greatly circumscribes the right even of
a private figure to obtain damages for the publication of newsworthy
facts about him, even when they are facts of a kind that people want
very much to conceal. To be identified in the newspaper as a rape victim
is intensely embarrassing. And it is not invited embarrassment. No one
asks to be raped; the plaintiff in [*Melvin v. Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
did not ask to be prosecuted for murder (remember, she was acquitted,
though whether she actually was innocent is unknown); Sidis did not
decide to be a prodigy; and Luther Haynes did not aspire to be a
representative figure in the great black migration from the South to the
North. People who do not desire the limelight and do not deliberately
choose a way of life or course of conduct calculated to thrust them into
it nevertheless have no legal right to extinguish it if the experiences
that have befallen them are newsworthy, even if they would prefer that
those experiences be kept private. The possibility of an involuntary
loss of privacy is recognized in the modern formulations of this branch
of the privacy tort, which require not only that the private facts
publicized be such as would make a reasonable person deeply offended by
such publicity but also that they be facts in which the public has no
legitimate interest. *Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra,* § 652D(b).

The two criteria, offensiveness and newsworthiness, are related. An
individual, and more pertinently perhaps the community, is most offended
by the publication of intimate personal facts when the community has no
interest in them beyond the voyeuristic thrill of penetrating the wall
of privacy that surrounds a stranger. The reader of a book about the
black migration to the North would have no legitimate interest in the
details of Luther Haynes's sex life; but no such details are disclosed.
Such a reader does have a legitimate interest in the aspects of Luther's
conduct that the book reveals. For one of Lemann's major themes is the
transposition virtually intact of a sharecropper morality characterized
by a family structure "matriarchal and elastic" and by an "extremely
unstable" marriage bond to the slums of the northern cities, and the
interaction, largely random and sometimes perverse, of that morality
with governmental programs to alleviate poverty. Public aid policies
discouraged Ruby and Luther from living together; public housing
policies precipitated a marriage  doomed to fail. No detail in
the book claimed to invade the Hayneses' privacy is not germane to the
story that the author wanted to tell, a story not only of legitimate but
of transcendent public interest.

The Hayneses question whether the linkage between the author's theme and
their private life really is organic. They point out that many social
histories do not mention individuals at all, let alone by name. That is
true. Much of social science, including social history, proceeds by
abstraction, aggregation, and quantification rather than by case
studies; the economist Robert Fogel has won a Nobel prize for his
statistical studies of economic history, including, not wholly unrelated
to the subject of Lemann's book, the history of Negro slavery in the
United States. But it would be absurd to suggest that cliometric or
other aggregative, impersonal methods of doing social history are the
only proper way to go about it and presumptuous to claim even that they
are the best way. Lemann's book has been praised to the skies by
distinguished scholars, among them black scholars covering a large
portion of the ideological spectrum — Henry Louis Gates Jr., William
Julius Wilson, and Patricia Williams. Lemann's methodology places the
individual case history at center stage. If he cannot tell the story of
Ruby Daniels without waivers from every person who she thinks did her
wrong, he cannot write this book.

Well, argue the Hayneses, at least Lemann could have changed their
names. But the use of pseudonyms would not have gotten Lemann and Knopf
off the legal hook. The details of the Hayneses' lives recounted in the
book would identify them unmistakably to anyone who has known the
Hayneses well for a long time (members of their families, for example),
or who knew them before they got married; and no more is required for
liability either in defamation law (citations omitted).

Lemann would have had to change some, perhaps many, of the details. But
then he would no longer have been writing history. He would have been
writing fiction. The nonquantitative study of living persons would be
abolished as a category of scholarship, to be replaced by the
sociological novel. That is a genre with a distinguished history
punctuated by famous names, such as Dickens, Zola, Stowe, Dreiser,
Sinclair, Steinbeck, and Wolfe, but we do not think that the law of
privacy makes it (or that the First Amendment would permit the law of
privacy to make it) the exclusive format for a social history of living
persons that tells their story rather than treating them as data points
in a statistical study. Reporting the true facts about real people is
necessary to "obviate any impression that the problems raised in the
[book] are remote or hypothetical." [*Gilbert v. Medical Economics Co.,
supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17792839258786586792).
And surely a composite portrait of ghetto residents would be attacked as
racial stereotyping.

*The Promised Land* does not afford the reader a titillating glimpse of
tabooed activities. The tone is decorous and restrained. Painful though
it is for the Hayneses to see a past they would rather forget brought
into the public view, the public needs the information conveyed by the
book, including the information about Luther and Dorothy Haynes, in
order to evaluate the profound social and political questions that the
book raises. Given the *Cox* decision, moreover, all the discreditable
facts about the Hayneses that are contained in judicial records are
beyond the power of tort law to conceal; and the disclosure of those
facts alone would strip away the Hayneses' privacy as effectively as
*The Promised Land* has done. (This *case,* it could be argued, has
stripped them of their privacy, since their story is now part of a
judicial record — the record of this case.) We do not think it is an
answer that Lemann got his facts from Ruby Daniels rather than from
judicial records. The courts got the facts from Ruby. We cannot see what
difference it makes that Lemann went to the source.

Ordinarily the evaluation and comparison of offensiveness and newsworthiness would be, like other questions of the application of a legal standard to the facts of a particular case, matters for a jury, not for a judge on a motion for summary judgment.  But summary judgment is properly granted to a defendant when on the basis of the evidence obtained in pretrial discovery no reasonable jury could render a verdict for the plaintiff, [*Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9272001251064530131&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) and that is the situation here. No modern cases decided after *Cox,* and precious few before, go as far as the plaintiffs would have us go in this case. Almost all the recent cases on which they rely &hellip; involve the vindication of paramount social interests, such as the protection of children, patients, and witnesses — interests not involved in this case. The plaintiffs' best post-*Cox* cases are [*Vassiliades v.  Garfinckel's, supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12881988089288894231) and [*Huskey v. National Broadcasting Co.* (N.D.Ill.1986),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18021807458979528821&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) the former involving before-and-after photos of a face lift, the latter involving television pictures of a prisoner dressed only in gym shorts.  Photographic invasions of privacy usually are more painful than narrative ones, and even partial nudity is a considerable aggravating factor. *Vassiliades* also involved the special issue of patient rights, though it was not emphasized by the court.

Illinois has been a follower rather than a leader in recognizing claims of invasion of privacy (citations omitted). The plaintiffs are asking us to innovate boldly in the name of the Illinois courts, and such a request is better addressed to those courts than to a federal court. If the plaintiffs had filed this case in an Illinois state court and it had been removed to the federal district court, they would have had no choice, and then we would have been duty-bound to be as innovative as we thought it plausible to suppose the Illinois courts would be. But the plaintiffs filed this suit in the district court originally — they *chose* the federal forum. And we have said before and will say again that plaintiffs who seek innovations in state law are ill advised to choose a federal court as their forum.

To any suggestion that the outer bounds of liability should be left to a
jury to decide we reply that in cases involving the rights protected by
the speech and press clauses of the First Amendment the courts insist on
firm judicial control of the jury. For the general principle, see [*New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964)][sullivan].

The publication of books is not at the sufferance of juries.

Does it follow, as the Hayneses' lawyer asked us rhetorically at oral
argument, that a journalist who wanted to write a book about
contemporary sexual practices could include the intimate details of
named living persons' sexual acts without the persons' consent? Not
necessarily, although the revelation of such details in the memoirs of
former spouses and lovers is common enough and rarely provokes a lawsuit
even when the former spouse or lover is still alive. The core of the
branch of privacy law with which we have been dealing in this case is
the protection of those intimate physical details the publicizing of
which would be not merely embarrassing  and painful but deeply
shocking to the average person subjected to such exposure. The public
has a legitimate interest in sexuality, but that interest may be
outweighed in such a case by the injury to the sensibilities of the
persons made use of by the author in such a way. *Restatement (Second)
of Torts, supra,* § 652D, comment h. At least the balance would be
sufficiently close to preclude summary judgment for the author and
publisher (citations omitted). 

The judgment for the defendants is

AFFIRMED.

### Public Figures <a name="public_figures"></a>

Most defamation and privacy cases deal early on with the issue of whether plaintiff is a public or a private figure. In struggling with these question, courts have discussed at least three varieties of public figures.

1. General-purpose public figures;
2. Limited-purpose public figures;
3. Involuntary public figures.

#### General Purpose Public Figures.

These are easy to spot, as the D.C. Circuit put it in [*Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications*]
(http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=90016016899445152060):

> A general public figure is a well-known "celebrity," his name a "household word." The public recognies him and follows his words and deeds, either because it regards his ideas, conduct, or judgment as worthy of the attention or because he actively pursues that consideration.

#### Limited-Purpose Public Figure

In its leading opinion on public *figures*, [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1974)][gertz], as opposed to public *officials*, [*New York Times v. Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1968)][sullivan], the United States Supreme Court identified at least two kinds of public figures:

> In some instances an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. More commonly, an *individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues*. In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions.

> Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects of his life. It is preferable to reduce the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.

The states and federal circuits have developed different tests for deciding whether and when a person is a limited-purpose public figure. The Fifth Circuit uses a three-part test:

1. The controversy at issue must be public both in the sense that people are discussing it and people other than the immediate participants in the controversy are likely to feel the impact of its resolution;
2. The plaintiff must have more than a trivial or tangential role in the controversy; and,
3. The alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy.

The Second Circuit uses a four-factor inquiry, which focuses on plaintiff's participation in the public controversy. This test requires the defendant to prove that plaintiff:

1. Successfully invited public attention to his views in an effort to influence others prior to the incident that is the subject of litigation;
2. Voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy related to the subject of the litigation; 
3. Assumed a position of prominence in the public controversy; and
4. Maintained regular and continuing access to the media.

[*Lerman v. Flynt Distrib, Co.* (2d Cir. 1984)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18352275970631466991).

The plaintiff in *Street v. NBC* (below) is a textbook example of a public figure for a limited purpose. 

#### Involuntary Public Figures

Some read [*Gertz*][gertz] as identifying yet a third variety of public figure, the involuntary public figure, based upon the Court's observation that:

> Hypothetically, it may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own, *but the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare.* For the most part those who attain this status have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes. More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, they invite attention and comment.

These distinction in the small number of cases discussing involuntary public figures seems to turn on whether the plaintiff voluntary sought to play a public role in the controversy that gave rise to her notoriety. Modern commentators suggest that even vigorous use of social media (Twitter, Facebook, and the like) could be used as evidence of one's public figure status.

### *Street v. National Broadcasting Co.*

#####(6th Circuit 1981)

* [Case in Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=4559741824903610057&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
* [Case in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadcasting_Co._v._United_States)
* [Case in Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=319+U.S.+190&appflag=67.12)

This is a Tennessee diversity case against the National Broadcasting Company for libel and invasion of privacy. The plaintiff-appellant, Victoria Price Street, was the prosecutrix and main witness in the famous rape trials of the Scottsboro boys, which occurred in Alabama more than forty years ago. NBC televised a play or historical drama
entitled "Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys," dramatizing the role of the local presiding judge in one of those trials.

The movie portrays Judge Horton as a courageous and tragic figure struggling to bring justice in a tense community gripped by racial prejudice and intent on vengeance against nine blacks accused of raping two white women. In the movie Judge Horton sets aside a jury verdict of
guilty because he believes that the evidence shows that the prosecutrix — plaintiff in this action — falsely accused the Scottsboro defendants. The play portrays the plaintiff in the derogatory light that Judge Horton apparently viewed her: as a woman attempting to send nine
innocent blacks to the electric chair for a rape they did not commit.

This case presents the question of what tort and First Amendment principles apply to an historical drama that allegedly defames a living person who participated in the historical events portrayed. The plaintiff's case is based on principles of libel law and "false light" invasion of privacy arising from the derogatory portrayal. NBC raises alternative claims and defenses: (1) the claim that the published material is not defamatory; (2) the claim of truth; (3) the common law privilege of fair comment; (4) the common law privilege of fair report on a judicial proceeding; (5) the First Amendment claim that
because the plaintiff is a public figure recovery must be based on a showing of malice; and (6) even if the malice standard is inapplicable, the claim that recovery must be based on a showing of negligence.

At the end of all the proof, District Judge Neese directed a verdict for defendant on the ground that even though plaintiff was not a public figure at the time of publication the defamatory matter was not negligently published. We affirm for the reason that the historical  events and persons portrayed are "public" as distinguished from "private." A malice standard applies to public figures under the First Amendment, and there is no evidence that the play was published with malice.

### I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

In April 1931, nine black youths were accused of raping two young white women while riding a freight train between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama. The case was widely discussed in the local, national, and foreign press. The youths were quickly tried in Scottsboro, Alabama, and all were found guilty and sentenced to death. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the convictions.  

The United States Supreme Court reversed all convictions on the ground that the defendants were denied the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The defendants were retried separately after a change of venue from
Scottsboro to Decatur, Alabama. Patterson was the first defendant retried, and this trial was the subject of the NBC production. In a jury trial before Judge Horton, he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Judge Horton set the verdict aside on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. Patterson and one other defendant, Norris,
were then tried before another judge on essentially the same evidence, convicted, and sentenced to death. The judge let the verdicts stand, and the convictions were affirmed by the Alabama Supreme Court. 

The United States Supreme Court again reversed, this time because blacks were systematically excluded from grand and petit juries. At his fourth retrial, Patterson was convicted and sentenced to seventy-five years in prison. 
Defendants Weems and Andrew Wright were also convicted on retrial and sentenced to a term of years. Defendant Norris was convicted and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the Alabama governor. Defendants Montgomery, Roberson, Williams, and Leroy Wright were released without retrial. Powell pled guilty to assault allegedly committed during an attempted escape. The last Scottsboro defendant was paroled in 1950.

The Scottsboro case aroused strong passions and conflicting opinions in the 1930s throughout the nation. Several all white juries convicted the Scottsboro defendants of rape. Two trial judges and the Alabama Supreme Court, at times by divided vote, let these verdicts stand. Judge Horton was the sole trial judge to find the facts in favor of the defendants. Liberal opinion supported Judge Horton's conclusions that the Scottsboro
defendants had been falsely accused.

During the lengthy course of the Scottsboro trials, newspapers frequently wrote about Victoria Price. She gave some interviews to the press. Thereafter, she disappeared from public view. The Scottsboro trials and her role in them continued to be the subject of public discussion, but there is no evidence that Mrs. Street sought publicity. NBC incorrectly stated in the movie that she was no longer living. After the first showing of "Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys," plaintiff notified NBC that she was living, and shortly thereafter she filed suit. Soon after plaintiff filed suit, NBC rebroadcast the dramatization
omitting the statement that plaintiff was no longer living.

#### The Dramatization

The script for "Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys" was based on one chapter of a book by Dr. Daniel Carter, an historian, entitled *Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South*. The movie is based almost entirely on the information in Dr. Carter's book, which, in turn, was based on Judge Horton's findings at the 1933 trial, the transcript of the trial, contemporaneous newspaper reports of the trial, and interviews with Judge Horton and others. NBC purchased the movie from an independent producer.

Plaintiff's major libel and invasion of privacy claims are based on nine scenes in the movie in which she is portrayed in a derogatory light. The essential facts concerning these claims are as follows:

1. After an opening prologue, black and white youths are shown fighting on a train.  The train is halted, and the blacks are arrested. The next scene shows plaintiff standing next to Ruby Bates at the tracks. Plaintiff claims that this scene, in effect, makes her a perjurer because she testified at the 1933 trial and in this case that she fainted while alighting from the train and did not regain consciousness until she was taken to a local grocery store. Judge Horton, in his opinion sustaining the motion for a new trial, found that the observations of other witnesses and the testimony of the examining
doctor contradicted her testimony in this respect. Horton concluded that it was unlikely that Victoria Price had fainted.

2. As plaintiff and Ruby Bates are led away from the tracks by the sheriff and his men, the sheriff in the play calls the two women a "couple of bums." There is no indication in Judge Horton's opinion, in the 1933 trial transcript, or in Dr. Carter's book that this comment was
actually made.

3. In a pretrial conversation between two lawyers representing the defendant, the play portrays one of them as advising restraint in the cross-examination of plaintiff Price. He says to the other defense lawyer: "The Scottsboro transcripts are really clear .... The defense at the last trial made one thing very clear, Victoria was a *whore,* and they got it in the neck for it ...." (Emphasis added.) There is no evidence that this specific conversation between the two defense lawyers actually occurred. Dr. Carter does state in his book that one of the purposes of the defense in cross-examining plaintiff was to discredit her testimony by introducing evidence that she was a common prostitute.
*Scottsboro* at 206.

4. Plaintiff in this action contends that the movie falsely portrays her as defensive and evasive during her direct and cross-examination. 

5. Plaintiff claims that the last question put to her on
cross-examination in the play is inaccurate. In the movie the defense attorney asks: "One more question: have you ever heard of a white woman being arrested for perjury when she was the complaining witness against Negroes in the entire history of the state of Alabama?" According to the 1933 trial transcript, the actual question was, "I want to ask you if you have ever heard of any single white woman ever being locked up in jail when she is the complaining witness against Negroes in the history of the state of Alabama?" Plaintiff objects to the insertion of the word "perjury" in the play.

6. In the play, Dr. Marvin Lynch, one of the doctors who examined plaintiff after she alighted from the train, approaches Judge Horton outside the courtroom and confides that he does not believe that the two women were raped by the Scottsboro boys. Dr. Lynch refuses to go on the
witness stand and so testify, however. Plaintiff argues that this scene is improper because it is not supported in the 1933 trial record. This is true. Neither the 1933 trial transcript nor Judge Horton's opinion make reference to this incident. The Carter book does state, however,
that Judge Horton told the author in a later interview that this incident occurred. *Scottsboro* at 214-15.

7. The play portrays events leading up to plaintiff's trip to Chattanooga with her friend, Ruby Bates. It was on the return trip to Alabama that the rape alleged occurred. Lester Carter, a defense witness in the play, testifies that he had intercourse with Ruby Bates on the night before the trip to Chattanooga and that plaintiff had intercourse with Jack Tiller. During the testimony there is a flashback that shows an exchange in a boxcar in which Ruby Bates suggests that they all go to Chattanooga  and plaintiff says, "[m]aybe Ruby and me could hustle there while you two [Carter and Tiller] got some kind of fill-in
work. What do you say?" This is an accurate abridgement of the substance of the actual testimony of Lester Carter at the 1933 trial, although Price denied, both at the 1933 trial and in the defamation trial below, that she had had intercourse with Tiller. Judge Horton specifically
found that she did not tell the truth. The dramatization quoted or closely paraphrased substantial portions of Judge Horton's 1933 opinion. 

8. Lester Carter also testifies in the play that plaintiff urged him to say that he had seen her raped. The 1933 trial transcript reveals that Carter actually testified that he overheard plaintiff tell another white youth that "if you don't testify according to what I testify I will see that you are took off the witness stand.&hellip;" Judge Horton in his opinion observed that there was evidence presented at the trial showing that Price encouraged others to support her version of what had happened.

9. Another witness in the play, Dallas Ramsey, testifies that he saw plaintiff and Ruby Bates in a "hobo jungle" near the train tracks in Chattanooga the night before the train trip back to Alabama. Ramsey testifies that plaintiff stated that she and her husband were looking
for work and that "her old man" was uptown scrounging for food. The play dramatizes Ramsey's testimony while he is on the stand by a flashback to the scene at the "hobo jungle." The flashback gives the impression that
plaintiff is perhaps inviting sexual advances from Ramsey, although the words used do not state this specifically. The substance of Ramsey's testimony, as portrayed in the play, is found in the 1933 trial transcript. The record provides no basis for the suggestive flashback.

### II. COMMON LAW CLAIMS AND DEFENSES

#### A. Defamatory Nature of the Published Material

Taken as a whole, the play conveys a defamatory image of the plaintiff. Although the words "bum" and "hustle" may be considered rhetorical hyperbole and therefore not necessarily defamatory, [*Letter Carriers v. Austin,* (S.Ct. 1974),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=923744859423605953) the reference to plaintiff as a "whore" and her portrayal as a perjurer and a suborner of perjury is obviously defamatory. The suggestive flashbacks showing her inviting sexual advances of Ramsey and Tiller reinforce the defamation. The effect of the drama as a whole is to create a character, Victoria Price. She is portrayed as a loose woman who falsely accuses the Scottsboro boys of raping her. This image of her character is created throughout the play by her own words and actions in the  flashbacks and in the witness chair and by what others say about her.

#### B. The Privilege of Fair Comment

The portrayal of Victoria Price in this way is not expressed in the play as a matter of opinion. The characterization is expressed as concrete fact. The common law privilege of fair comment, adopted in Tennessee and explained in [*Venn v. Tennessean Newspapers, Inc.,*(M.D.Tenn. 1962),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14047302044250172971)
*aff'd,* [313 F.2d 639 (6th Cir.),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18040896426752233502)
*cert. denied,* [374 U.S. 830 (1963),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=16196949732337435619&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
is now protected as opinion under the First Amendment, [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,* (S.Ct. 1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202).
But this play does not say to the viewer that this is NBC's opinion about the character and actions of Victoria Price. It shows her inviting sexual intercourse and swearing falsely. We do not believe this characterization fits within the traditional fair comment privilege
protecting opinion. *See* [*Cianci v. New York Times Publishing Co.,* (2nd Cir. 1980, *as amended* Oct. 27, 1980)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15742491952572175828&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(magazine article interpreting evidence of rape not expression of
opinion).

#### C. The Defense of Truth and the Privilege of Fair Report of a Judicial Proceeding

In his opinion setting aside the verdict, Judge Horton found, in effect, that NBC's characterization of Victoria Price was true. The movie characterizes her as Judge Horton found the facts in his opinion. This does not mean, however, that the case should be withdrawn from the jury on the basis of the defense of truth or the privilege of fair report of a judicial proceeding.

Neither Judge Horton's findings nor the final convictions based on the testimony of Victoria Price and affirmed on appeal settle the question of truth. That still remains an open question. Technical doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not apply in this context. Neither Victoria Price nor NBC were parties in the 1930s trials. In addition, citizens obviously have a right to attack the fairness of a trial. Judicial proceedings resolve disputes, but they do not establish the truth for all time. In libel cases the question of truth is normally
one for the jury in a defamation action.

Many of the scenes actually quote or paraphrase the trial transcript, but the movie is not a completely accurate report of the trial. Witnesses who corroborate Victoria Price's version of the facts are omitted. The portions of the original trial that show her as a perjurer and a promiscuous woman are emphasized. The flashbacks consistently show plaintiff's conduct in a derogatory light. The flashbacks entirely accept the theory of the case presented by Judge Horton and the defense and reject the theory of the case presented by the state and the plaintiff. Under such circumstances the common law privilege permitting publication of defamatory material as a part of a fair and accurate report on judicial proceedings is not satisfied. The element of balance and neutrality is missing. *See* [*Langford v. Vanderbilt University,* (Tenn.App. 1958)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2991746111379933624).

### III. THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSES

#### A. Plaintiff was a Public Figure During the Scottsboro Trials

Since common law defenses do not support the directed verdict for NBC,
we must reach the constitutional issues, particularly the question
whether plaintiff should be characterized as a "public figure." In
*Gertz,* the Supreme Court held that one characterized as a "public
figure," as distinguished from a private individual, "may recover for
injury to reputation *only on clear and convincing proof* that the
defamatory falsehood was made *with knowledge of its falsity or with
reckless disregard for the truth.*" [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202)
(emphasis added). In balancing the need to protect "private
personality" and reputation  against the need "to assure to
the freedoms of speech and press that 'breathing space' essential to
their free exercise," the Supreme Court has developed a general test to
determine public figure status.

*Gertz* establishes a two-step analysis to determine if an individual is
a public figure. First, does a "public controversy" exist? Second, what
is "the nature and extent of [the] individual's participation" in that
public controversy? [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Three factors determine the "nature and extent" of an individual's
involvement: the extent to which participation in the controversy is
voluntary, the extent to which there is access to channels of effective
communication in order to counteract false statements, and the
prominence of the role played in the public controversy. [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

The Supreme Court has not clearly defined the elements of a "public controversy." It is evident that it is not simply any controversy of general or public interest. Not all judicial proceedings are public controversies.  Several factors, however, lead to the conclusion that the Scottsboro case is the kind of public controversy referred to in *Gertz.* The Scottsboro trials were the focus of major public debate over the ability of our courts to render even-handed justice. It generated widespread press and attracted public attention for several years. It was also a contributing factor in changing public attitudes about the right of black citizens to equal treatment under law and in changing constitutional principles governing the right to counsel and the exclusion of blacks from the jury.

The first factor in determining the nature and extent of plaintiff's
participation is the prominence of her role in the public controversy.
She was the only alleged victim, and she was the major witness for the
State in the prosecution of the nine black youths. Ruby Bates, the other
young woman who earlier had testified against the defendants, later
recanted her incriminating testimony. Plaintiff was left as the sole
prosecutrix. Therefore, she played a prominent role in the public
controversy.

The second part of the test of public figure status is also met.
Plaintiff had "access to the channels of effective communication and
hence ... a ... realistic opportunity to counteract false statements."
[*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202).
The evidence indicates that plaintiff recognized her importance to the
criminal trials and the interest of the public in her as a personality.
The press clamored to interview her. She clearly had access to the media
and was able to broadcast her view of the events.

The most troublesome issue is whether plaintiff "voluntarily" "thrust"
herself to the forefront of this public controversy. It cannot be said
that a rape victim "voluntarily" injects herself into a criminal
prosecution for rape. *See* [*Time, Inc. v. Firestone,* (S.Ct. 1976)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12685855173622583678).
In such an instance, voluntariness in the legal sense is closely bound
to the issue of truth. If she was raped, her participation in the
initial legal proceedings was involuntary for the purpose of determining
her public figure status; if she falsely accused the defendants, her
participation in this controversy was "voluntary." But legal standards
in libel cases should not be drawn so that either the courts or the
press must first determine the issue of truth before they can determine
whether an individual should be treated as a public or a private figure.
The principle of libel law should not be drawn in such a way that it
forces the press, in an uncertain public controversy, to guess correctly
about a woman's chastity.

When the issue of truth and the issue of voluntariness are the same, it
is necessary to determine the public figure status of the individual
without regard to whether she "voluntarily" thrust herself in the
forefront of the public controversy. If  there were no
evidence of voluntariness other than that turning on the issue of truth,
we would not consider the fact of voluntariness. In such a case, the
other factors — prominence and access to media — alone would determine
public figure status. But in this case, there is evidence of
voluntariness not bound up with the issue of truth. Plaintiff gave press
interviews and aggressively promoted her version of the case outside of
her actual courtroom testimony. In the context of a widely-reported,
intense public controversy concerning the fairness of our criminal
justice system, plaintiff was a public figure under *Gertz* because she
played a major role, had effective access to the media and encouraged
public interest in herself.

#### B. Plaintiff Remains a Public Figure 

The Supreme Court has explicitly reserved the question of "whether or
when an individual who was once a public figure may lose that status by
the passage of time." [*Wolston v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc.,* (S.Ct. 1979)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14330147117680431779).
In *Wolston* the District of Columbia Circuit found that plaintiff was a
public figure and retained that status for the purpose of later
discussion of the espionage case in which he was called as a witness.
The Supreme Court found that the plaintiff's role in the original public
controversy was so minor that he was not a public figure. It therefore
reserved the question of whether a person retains his public figure
status.

Plaintiff argues that even if she was a public figure at the time of the
1930s trial, she lost her public figure status over the intervening
forty years. We reject this argument and hold that once a person becomes
a public figure in connection with a particular controversy, that person
remains a public figure thereafter for purposes of later commentary or
treatment of *that controversy.* This rule finds support in both case
law and analysis of the constitutional malice standard.

On this issue the Fifth Circuit has reached the same conclusion as the
District of Columbia Circuit in *Wolston.* In [*Brewer v. Memphis
Publishing Co., Inc.,* (5th Cir. 1980),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3470754345585952877&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
plaintiff sued when a newspaper implied that she was reviving a
long-dormant romantic relationship with Elvis Presley. The Fifth Circuit
concluded that although the passage of time might narrow the range of
topics protected by a malice standard, plaintiff remained a public
figure when the defendant commented on her romantic relationship. The
court noted that plaintiff's name continued to be connected with Presley
even after her retirement from show business.

Other courts have assumed *sub silentio* that the public figure status
was retained over the passage of time. *See, e. g.,* [*Meeropol v. Nizer,* (2d Cir. 1977),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15243536244801528103&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
*cert. denied,* [(S.Ct. 1978)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=1891215749533979497&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(having spent most of their early years in limelight, sons of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg are public figures for purposes of subsequent commentary
on Rosenberg trials). Some courts have relied on a pre-*Gertz*
"newsworthiness" analysis to support a finding that the passage of time
did not alter the standard of liability. 

Our nation depends on "robust debate" to determine the best answer to
public controversies of this sort. The public figure
doctrine makes it possible for publishers to provide information on such
issues to the debating public, undeterred by the threat of liability
except in cases of actual malice. Developed in the context
of contemporaneous reporting, the doctrine promotes a forceful exchange
of views.

Considerations that underlie the public figure doctrine in the context
of contemporaneous reporting also apply to later historical or dramatic
treatment of the same events. Past public figures who now live in
obscurity do not lose their access to channels of communication if they
choose to comment on their role in the past public controversy. And
although the publisher of history does not operate under journalistic
deadlines it generally makes little difference in terms of accuracy and
verifiability that the events on which a publisher is reporting occurred
decades ago. Although information may come to light over the course of
time, the distance of years does not necessarily make more data
available to a reporter: memories fade; witnesses forget; sources
disappear.

There is no reason for the debate to be any less vigorous when events
that are the subject of current discussion occurred several years
earlier. The mere passage of time does not automatically diminish the
significance of events or the public's need for information. A nation
that prizes its heritage need have no illusions about its past. It is no
more fitting for the Court to constrain the analysis of past events than
to stem the tide of current news. From Alfred Dreyfus to Alger Hiss,
famous cases have been debated and reinterpreted by commentators and
historians. A contrary rule would tend to restrain efforts to shed new
light on historical events and reconsideration of past errors.

The plaintiff was the pivotal character in the most famous rape case of
the twentieth century. It became a political controversy as well as a
legal dispute. As the white prosecutrix of nine black youths during an
era of racial prejudice in the South, she aroused the attention of the
nation. The prosecutions were among the first to focus the conscience of
the nation on the question of the ability of our system of justice to
provide fair trials to blacks in the South. The question persists today.
As long as the question remains, the Scottsboro boys case will not be
relegated to the dusty pages of the scholarly treatise. It will remain a
living controversy.

#### C. Evidence Insufficient to Support Malice

A plaintiff may not recover under the malice standard unless there is
"clear and convincing proof" that the defamation was published "with
knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth."
[*Gertz,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
There is no evidence that NBC had  knowledge that its
portrayal of Victoria Price was false or that NBC recklessly disregarded
the truth. The derogatory portrayal of Price in the movie is based in
all material respects on the detailed findings of Judge Horton at the
trial and Dr. Carter in his book. When the truth is uncertain and seems
undiscoverable through further investigation, reliance on these two
sources is not unreasonable.

We gain perspective on this question when we put to ourselves another
case. Dr. Carter, in his book, persuasively argues, based on the
evidence, that the Communist Party financed and controlled the defense
of the Scottsboro boys. A different playwright might choose to portray
Judge Horton as some Southern newspapers portrayed him at the time — as
an evil judge who associated himself with a Communist cause and gave his
approval to interracial rape in order to curry favor with the eastern
press. The problem would be similar had Judge Horton — for many years
before his death an obscure private citizen — sued the publisher for
libel.

Some controversial historical events like the Scottsboro trials become
symbolic and take on an overlay of political meaning. Speech about such
events becomes in part political speech. The hypothetical case and the
actual case before us illustrate that an individual's social philosophy
and political leanings color his historical perspective. His political
opinions cause him to draw different lessons from history and to see
historical events and facts in a different light. He believes the
historical evidence he wants to believe and casts aside other evidence
to the contrary. So long as there is no evidence of bad faith or
conscious or extreme disregard of the truth, the speaker in such a
situation does not violate the malice standard. His version of history
may be wrong, but the law does not punish him for being a bad historian.

The malice standard is flexible and encourages diverse political
opinions and robust debate about social issues. It tolerates silly
arguments and strange ways of yoking facts together in unusual patterns.
But it is not infinitely expandable. It does not abolish all the common
law of libel even in the political context. It still protects us against
the "big political lie," the conscious or reckless falsehood. We do not
have that in this case.

Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

## What About Other Torts?

What if instead of suing for defamation, the unhappy public figure sues for intentional infliction of emotional distress?

## *Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,*

###### United States Supreme Court (1988)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5069891851949874011)
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=108+S.Ct.+876&appflag=67.12)
* [case at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell)  
* [Image of the Campari ad](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/falwell/campariL.jpg)

The inside front cover of the November 1983 issue of Hustler Magazine
featured a "parody" of an advertisement for Campari Liqueur that
contained the name and picture of preacher Jerry Falwell and was entitled "Jerry
Falwell talks about his first time." This parody was modeled after
actual Campari ads that included interviews with various celebrities
about their "first times." Although it was apparent by the end of each
interview that this meant the first time they sampled Campari, the ads
clearly played on the sexual double entendre of the general subject of
"first times." Copying the form and layout of these Campari ads,
Hustler's editors chose respondent as the featured celebrity and drafted
an alleged "interview" with him in which he states that his "first time"
was during a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an
outhouse. The Hustler parody portrays respondent and his mother as drunk
and immoral, and suggests that respondent is a hypocrite who preaches
only when he is drunk. In small print at the bottom of the page, the ad
contains the disclaimer, "ad parody — not to be taken seriously." The
magazine's table of contents also lists the ad as "Fiction; Ad and
Personality Parody."

Soon after the November issue of Hustler became available to the public, Falwell sued Hustler Magazine and Larry Flynt to recover damages for libel, invasion of privacy, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case proceeded to
trial. At the close of the evidence, the District Court
granted a directed verdict for Flynt and Hustler on the invasion of privacy
claim. The jury then found against Falwell on the libel claim,
specifically finding that the ad parody could not "reasonably be
understood as describing actual facts about Falwell or actual
events in which [he] participated." The jury found for Falwell on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, however, and stated that he should be awarded $100,000 in

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
affirmed &hellip; rejecting Flynt and Hustler's argument that the "actual malice"
standard of [*New York Times Co.* v. *Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964)][sullivan] 
must be met before Falwell (concededly a public figure) could recover for emotional distress.

In the Fourth Circuit's view, the *New York Times* decision emphasized the
constitutional importance not of the falsity of the statement or the
defendant's disregard for the truth, but of the heightened level of
culpability embodied in the requirement of "knowing . . . or reckless"
conduct. Here, the *New York*  *Times* standard is satisfied by
the state-law requirement, and the jury's finding, that the defendants
have acted intentionally or recklessly, and that the sole issue before the court was "whether [the ad's] publication was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional
infliction of emotional distress." 

This case presents us with a novel question involving First Amendment
limitations upon a State's authority to protect its citizens from the
intentional infliction of emotional distress. We must decide whether a
public figure may recover damages for emotional harm caused by the
publication of an ad parody offensive to him, and doubtless gross and
repugnant in the eyes of most. Falwell would have us find that a
State's interest in protecting public figures from emotional distress is
sufficient to deny First Amendment protection to speech that is patently
offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury, even when that
speech could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual
facts about the public figure involved. This we decline to do.&hellip;

Of course, this does not mean that *any* speech about a public figure is
immune from sanction in the form of damages. Since [*New York Times Co.*
v. *Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964),][sullivan] we have consistently ruled that a public figure may hold a speaker liable for the damage to reputation caused by publication of a
defamatory falsehood, but only if the statement was made "with knowledge
that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or
not." &hellip; False statements of fact are particularly
valueless; they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the
marketplace of ideas, and they cause damage to an individual's
reputation that cannot easily be repaired by counterspeech, however
persuasive or effective. See [*Gertz,* 418 U. S., at 340, 344, n.
9](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=hustler+flynt&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
But even though falsehoods have little value in and of themselves, they
are "nevertheless inevitable in free debate," and a rule
that would impose strict liability on a publisher for false factual
assertions would have an undoubted "chilling" effect on speech relating
to public figures that does have constitutional value. "Freedoms of
expression require " 'breathing space.'" &hellip; This breathing space is provided by a constitutional rule that allows
public figures to recover for libel or defamation only when they can
prove *both* that the statement was false and that the statement was
made with the requisite level of culpability.

Respondent argues, however, that a different standard should apply in
this case because here the State seeks to prevent not reputational
damage, but the severe emotional distress suffered by the person who is
the subject of an offensive publication. Cf. [*Zacchini* v.
*Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.,* 433 U. S. 562
(1977)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16238771870259020023)
(ruling that the "actual malice" standard does not apply to the tort of
appropriation of a right of publicity). In respondent's view, and in the
view of the  Court of Appeals, so long as the utterance was
intended to inflict emotional distress, was outrageous, and did in fact
inflict serious emotional distress, it is of no constitutional import
whether the statement was a fact or an opinion, or whether it was true
or false. It is the intent to cause injury that is the gravamen of the
tort, and the State's interest in preventing emotional harm simply
outweighs whatever interest a speaker may have in speech of this type.

Generally speaking the law does not regard the intent to inflict
emotional distress as one which should receive much solicitude, and it
is quite understandable that most if not all jurisdictions have chosen
to make it civilly culpable where the conduct in question is
sufficiently "outrageous." But in the world of debate about public
affairs, many things done with motives that are less than admirable are
protected by the First Amendment. In [*Garrison* v. *Louisiana,* 379 U.
S. 64
(1964),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6463657344879720774&q=hustler+flynt&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
we held that even when a speaker or writer is motivated by hatred or ill
will his expression was protected by the First Amendment:

> "Debate on public issues will not be uninhibited if the speaker must
> run the risk that it will be proved in court that he spoke out of
> hatred; even if he did speak out of hatred, utterances honestly
> believed contribute to the free interchange of ideas and the
> ascertainment of truth." *Id.,* at 73.

Thus while such a bad motive may be deemed controlling for purposes of
tort liability in other areas of the law, we think the First Amendment
prohibits such a result in the area of public debate about public
figures.

Were we to hold otherwise, there can be little doubt that political
cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to damages awards without
any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject. Webster's
defines a caricature as "the deliberately distorted picturing or
imitating of a person, literary style, etc. by exaggerating features or
mannerisms for satirical effect." The appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on exploitation of unfortunate physical traits or politically embarrassing events — an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the subject of the portrayal. The art of the cartoonist is often not reasoned or evenhanded, but slashing and one-sided. One cartoonist
expressed the nature of the art in these words:

> "The political cartoon is a weapon of attack, of scorn and ridicule
> and satire; it is least effective when it tries to pat some politician
> on the back. It is usually as welcome as a bee sting and is always
> controversial in some quarters."

Several famous examples of this type of intentionally injurious speech
were drawn by Thomas Nast, probably the greatest American cartoonist to
date, who was associated for many years during the post-Civil War era
with Harper's Weekly. In the pages of that publication Nast conducted a
graphic vendetta against William M. "Boss" Tweed and his corrupt
associates in New York City's "Tweed Ring." It has been described by one
historian of the subject as "a sustained attack which in its passion and
effectiveness stands alone in the history of American graphic art." &hellip;
Another writer
explains that the success of the Nast cartoon was achieved "because of
the emotional impact of its presentation. It continuously goes beyond
the bounds of good taste and conventional manners."

Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon
portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic
depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public
and political debate. Nast's castigation of the Tweed Ring, Walt
McDougall's characterization of Presidential candidate James G. Blaine's
banquet with the millionaires at Delmonico's as "The Royal  Feast
of Belshazzar," and numerous other efforts have undoubtedly had an
effect on the course and outcome of contemporaneous debate. Lincoln's
tall, gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt's glasses and teeth, and
Franklin D. Roosevelt's jutting jaw and cigarette holder have been
memorialized by political cartoons with an effect that could not have
been obtained by the photographer or the portrait artist. From the
viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have
been considerably poorer without them.

Falwell contends, however, that the caricature in question here was
so "outrageous" as to distinguish it from more traditional political
cartoons. There is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his
mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political
cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were
possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from
the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But
we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite sure that the
pejorative description "outrageous" does not supply one.
"Outrageousness" in the area of political and social discourse has an
inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose
liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the
basis of their dislike of a particular expression. An "outrageousness"
standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to
be awarded because the speech in question may have an adverse emotional
impact on the audience. See [*NAACP* v. *Claiborne Hardware Co.* (S.Ct. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7271075303659098319) ("Speech does not lose its protected character. . . simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action"). 

> We conclude that public figures and public officials may not recover for
the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of
publications such as the one here at issue without showing in addition
that the publication *contains a false statement of fact* which was made
with "actual malice," *i.e.,* with knowledge that the statement was
false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true. 

For reasons heretofore stated this claim cannot, consistently with
the First Amendment, form a basis for the award of damages when the
conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad
parody involved here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
accordingly

*Reversed.*
