## Defamation 

Defamation is probably as old as the human race, 
an ancient wrong made modern by new and pervasive forms of communication.
False statements come in all guises in the law: 
fraud, perjury, false advertising, unfair competition, and so on.
A false statement of fact that harms a person's reputation is called defamation. 
A tort.

Artists and entertainers have First Amendment rights to tell stories, 
or write songs, or make movies, 
but what happens when those free speech rights 
collide with the rights of others? 
What if an author's bestselling memoir 
names names and defames others in the telling of her tale?
What if character in a television docu-drama (*Wild Wild Country* or *Making A Murderer*)
makes false statements about a living person 
and harms their reputation?

What if by telling her own story, 
an author invades the privacy of others? 
"Steals" their "life story"? 
Publicly discloses embarrassing private facts about their lives?

Every major film attracts lawsuits, 
and some plaintiffs sue 
even though they are not mentioned by name. 
Docu-dramas invite litigation, 
because they purport to dramatize "real" events. 

What if documentary filmmakers wearing hidden microphones 
and cameras make a documentary about a quack doctor 
who is selling banned substances, 
or unsafe herbal remedies? 
Invasion of privacy? 
Or investigative journalism? 
Or some other species of reality entertainment?

Stories, songs, movies, even photos about real people, 
may defame them, 
if those works of art contain or suggest false statements of fact.

### Restatement 2nd Torts § 558 

###### Elements of a Cause of Action for Defamation

To create liability for defamation there must be:

1. a false and defamatory statement concerning another;
2. an unprivileged publication to a third party;
3. fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and
4. either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 558 (1977)][r2t-558].

### Libel v. Slander

The common law origins of defamation lie in the torts of "slander" (a spoken harmful statement in a transient form, especially speech) and "libel", each of which gives a common law right of action. 

Two forms: Libel and slander:

* Libel (for a handy mnemonic, it sounds like "label") is defamation in print; it's written or recorded, as in television or movies. 
* Slander is defamation by way of the spoken word.

### Restatement 2nd Torts § 559 

###### Defamatory Communication Defined

A communication is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another 
as to lower him in the estimation of the community 
or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 559 (1977)][r2t-559]

### Pre-*New York Times v. Sullivan* 

First let's look at the rules for stating a claim for defamation as they existed before [*New York Time v. Sullivan*][sullivan] (US 1968). 

A plaintiff suing for defamation had to prove:

1. A statement had been made about the plaintiff;
2. The statement had been "published" to at least one other party;
3. The statement was false (presumed at common law);
4. The statement harmed the subject's reputation by lowering his or her standing in at least some part of the community. 

### Defamation Per Se

All states, 
except Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee, 
recognize that some categories of false statements are so harmful 
that they are considered to be *defamatory per se*. 
In the common law tradition, 
damages for such false statements are presumed and do not have to be proven.

Statements are defamatory *per se* where they falsely impute to the plaintiff one or more of the following:

1. Allegations or imputations "injurious to another in their trade, business, or profession"
2. Allegations or imputations "of loathsome disease" (historically leprosy and sexually transmitted disease, now also includes mental illness)
3. Allegations or imputations of "unchastity" (usually only in unmarried people and sometimes only in women)
4. Allegations or imputations of criminal activity (sometimes only crimes of [moral turpitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_turpitude))

### Defamation Meets First Amendment

Sometimes called the constitutionalization of defamation law, 
[*New York Times v. Sullivan*][sullivan] 
changed everything for public officials 
who don't like the way they are portrayed in the press. 
It all started in Montgomery, Alabama and the civil rights movement in the South. 

## *New York Times v. Sullivan*

###### US Supreme Court 1964

* [*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=376+us+254&appflag=67.12) (US 1964). 
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan).
* [NYTimes Editorial: The Uninhibited Press 50 Years Later](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/the-uninhibited-press-50-years-later.html).

![heed](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/documented-rights/exhibit/section4/detail/images/heed-rising-voices.jpg)

* [Image of "Heed Their Rising Voices" ad][heed]'
* [Transcript of "Heed Their Rising Voices ad][heed_transcript] 

On March 29th, 1960, civil rights groups, including The Committee To Defend Martin Luther King and The Struggle For Freedom In The South ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times. The ad, captioned ["Heed Their Rising Voices,"][heed], began:

> As the whole world knows by now, 
> thousands of Southern Negro students are engaged 
> in wide-spread non-violent demonstrations 
> in positive affirmation of the right to live in human dignity 
> as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
> In their efforts to uphold these guarantees, 
> they are being met by an unprecedented wave of terror 
> by those who would deny and negate that document 
> which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom.

The ad went on to list examples of official police intimidation and alleged that certain actions and events had deprived the students and demonstrators of their rights. 

> It is uncontroverted that some of the statements 
> contained in the two paragraphs 
> were not accurate descriptions of events which occurred in Montgomery.

L.B. Sullivan was the police commissioner for the city of Montgomery. 
Even though he wasn't named in the ad, 
Sullivan filed suit against the *New York Times*, 
alleging that it had wrongfully implied that he was guilty of misconduct. 
Four other suits were filed by other government officials. 

At trial the evidence showed 
that at least some of the statements in the ad were incorrect. 
The trial jury awarded Sullivan $500,000 in damages, 
and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the verdict. 

A unanimous Supreme Court reversed, 
in essence overruling Alabama's interpretation of its own defamation laws. 
The Court held that the First Amendment 
required that in defamation actions brought by public officials, 
the plaintiff official must prove 
that the statement was made with "*actual malice,*" meaning it was made 
*with knowledge that the statement was false* 
or *with reckeless disregard for the truth*. 

> We consider this case 
> against the background of a profound national commitment 
> to the principle that debate on public issues 
> should be uninhibited, robust, and wide- open, 
> and that it may well include vehement, caustic, 
> and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public official.

To protect news organizations from defamation claims, 
the Supreme Court held that the Constitution 
required public officials to prove actual malice to state a claim. 
Not only that, but in defamation cases, 
appellate court were charged with the duty 
to examine *the entire record* on review 
to insure that a trial judgment did not tread on First Amendment freedoms. 

### Lawsuits Over False Statements of Fact

In the wake of [*New York Times v. Sullivan,*][sullivan] 
the defamation rules changed 
and prospective plaintiffs were sorted into at least four different categories: 

- Private Figures (Ordinary People)
- Public Officials (Politicians) 
- Public Figures (Celebrities)
- Limited Purpose Public Figures (ordinary people who suddenly become famous because of their association with a particular event or issue).

If a public official or a public figure (celebrity) wishes to sue someone for defaming them they must prove [actual malice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice).

### § 580A Defamation of Public Official or Public Figure

One who publishes a false and defamatory communication concerning a public official or public figure in regard to his conduct, fitness or role in that capacity is subject to liability, if, but only if, he

(a) knows that the statement is false and that it defames the other person, or
(b) acts in reckless disregard of these matters.

### Actual Malice 

Do not confuse *actual malice* with *legal malice*. 
In defamation law, actual malice means 
the defendant who allegedly made a defamatory statement
did so with *with knowledge that the statement was false* 
or *with reckeless disregard for the truth* 
Actual malice does not mean evil intent or evil purpose, 
it means the defendant knew the statement was false and made it anyway, 
or had reckless disregard for the truth.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 580A (1977)][r2t-580A](Defamation of Public Official or Public Figure).

### Complexity

Like the question of privacy rights, 
defamation law is complex. How complex?
Take a look at a table we use in media law to decide fault standards, damages, 
and burdens of proof in defamation cases.

Plaintiff's Status  | Minimum Fault Standard | Damages Available | Burden of Proof |
------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
Public official or figure | Clear Actual Malice | Presumed and Punitive | Plaintiff Proves Falsity|
Private Figure, Public Concern | Negligence | Compensatory "Actual" | Plaintiff Proves Falsity |
Private Figure, Private Concern | Probably Strict Liability | Presumed and Punitive | Truth a Defense<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> |

<b id="f1">1</b> Not resolved by [*Hepps*][hepps], 
in which a state statute said that defendants had the burden of proving that allegedly defamatory statements were true. 
The trial judge thought the statute was unconstitutional 
and instructed the jury that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving falsity:[↩](#a1)

> To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, 
> we hold that the common-law presumption 
> that defamatory speech is false cannot stand 
> when a plaintiff seeks damages against a media defendant.

[*Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps.*][hepps] (US 1986).

And that's just state and federal law in the United States.

#### International Comparisons

Should the law force the allegedly defamed plaintiff 
to prove that the communications were false? 
Or should we instead force the defendant media company 
to prove that the statements were true? 

At common law, the defamed plaintiff made her claim,
and the allegedly defamatory statement was presumed to be false,
and it was up to the defendant to assert truth as a defense. 
But modern American defamation law sometimes makes the plaintiff prove falsity.

In England, this development was specifically rejected in [*Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-local-authorities-cannot-institute-libel-actions-derbyshire-county-council-v-times-newspapers-ltd-and-others--house-of-lords-lord-keith-lord-griffiths-lord-goff-of-chieveley-lord-brownewilkinson-and-lord-woolf-18-february-1993-1473954.html) (1993), and it was also rejected in Canada in [*Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_v._Church_of_Scientology_of_Toronto) (1995), and more recently in [*Grant v. Torstar Corp.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_v._Torstar_Corp.) (2009). 

In Australia, the High Court held in [*Theophanous v. The Herald & Weekly Times Ltd*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanous_v_Herald_%26_Weekly_Times_Ltd) (1994) that the Australian constitution implied a freedom of political communication and a freedom to publish material discussing government and political matters, but *Theophanous* was overruled by the High Court of Australia in [*Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_v_Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation) (1997).

As in privacy rights and celebrity/publicity rights, the protection or licensing of rights call for expert contract draftsmanship. 

Now let's look at some entertainment industry cases where public officials and figures alleged defamation.

## *Davis v. Constantin Costa-Gavras*

###### US District Court, S.D. New York (1987)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15465616831450742963)
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=654fsupp653&appflag=67.12)
* [Loyola Entertainment Law Journal Case Note](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1134&context=elr).

A summary of events leading up to the lawsuit:

> Thomas Hauser wrote a book, *The Execution of Charles Horman,* which developed the thesis of Ed Horman, Charles' father, that the US military in Chile had known and approved of the killing of his son by Pinochet's troops. Four years later, Costa-Gavras made a well-received movie, *Missing*, starring Jack Lemmon in the role of Ed Horman and Sally Field as his wife. *Missing* was a fictionalized version of the book, *Execution*, with the U.S. military head named Ray Tower. Davis, who had not sued the book's author or publisher, sued the movie director and studio for defamation. The legal issue posed by the case was whether there was any evidence of "actual malice" that would satisfy the *New York Times* standard.

> Paul C. Weiler, Gary Myers, *Entertainment, Media, and the Law: Text, Cases, and Problems* (4th Ed. 2011).

MILTON POLLACK, Senior District Judge.

The defamation charged in the complaint is that in their film, "Missing," defendants (including Universal Studios) allegedly portrayed with actual malice that plaintiff, the Commander of the United States Military Group and Chief of the United States Mission to Chile at the time of the 1973 coup in Chile, ordered or approved a Chilean order to kill Charles Horman, an American residing in Chile.

Actual malice is established in a public figure defamation litigation only where defendant publishes a statement "with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." [*New York Times v. Sullivan,* (US 1964) ][sullivan]. Reckless disregard in such a case means that a defendant published after he "in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication." [*St. Amant v. Thompson* (US 1968.)][amant]

### *Designated Evidence Offered by Plaintiff*

Plaintiff alleges that there are four general categories of purported
evidence in the paper defense to the motion from which to find actual
malice on behalf of defendants: 

1. that defendants' "entire purpose in making 'Missing' was to show plaintiff as responsible for Charles Horman's death"; 
2. that defendants' reliance on Thomas Hauser's book *The Execution of Charles Horman ("Execution ")* was unreasonable; 
3. that defendants never consulted with plaintiff on the facts presented in the film; and 
4. that "Missing" contains scenes portraying certain episodes which defendants knew were embroidered.

An analysis of the record shows that to accept the plaintiff's opposition to summary judgment would require a distortion of the proofs, deviation from applicable law, and wrenching of the film out of its plain context.

#### A. *The Thesis of the Film*

Plaintiff has produced no evidence in his papers to substantiate his
assertion that the purpose of "Missing" was to make a non-fictional film
establishing that Ray Davis, the plaintiff, was responsible for Charles
Horman's death. To the contrary, the papers unalterably establish that
the film is not a non-fictional documentary or aimed at Ray Davis as an
individual, and that it cannot be understood as other than a
dramatization of a true story. The film includes fictional characters
and a composite portrayal of the American military presence in Chile at
the time of the uprising and Allende coup.

The theme of the film is the search for a missing man by his father and
his wife. The man who disappeared is finally found to have been executed
by the Chilean military. The film is *based upon* a true story. It is
only in that setting that the composite conduct of the American
governmental representatives in Chile at the time and the degree of
their assistance in that search comes under scrutiny and criticism.
There is no person named Ray Davis referred to in the film at any time.
Ray Tower, with whom the plaintiff associates himself, is a symbolic
fictional composite of the entire American political and military
entourage in Chile.

The film derives from and is solidly documented and supported by the
stories relied on by the filmmakers, taken from the acts and statements
of the concerned father and the anguished wife set forth in detail in
Thomas Hauser's book, *Execution.* Those sources are shown to have been
heavily investigated and confirmed by the filmmakers, who entertained no
serious doubts of their truth or knowledge to the contrary of what they
portrayed.

We pause to point out that the Supreme Court has emphasized that "actual
malice" in the context of the First Amendment does not even include
"spite, hostility or intention to harm." &hellip; Rather, the actual malice inquiry
focuses on the publisher's state of mind regarding the truth of his
statements.&hellip;

#### B. *Defendants' Reliance on Hauser's Book*

"Missing" is a dramatic portrayal of events and interpretations detailed
in Thomas Hauser's book, *Execution.* The substance of the movie's
scenes is extracted directly from *Execution.* To meet those facts,
plaintiff purports to suggest that defendants' reliance on Hauser's book
was unreasonable and that Hauser's credentials would have disclosed him
to be "suspect" had a good faith search by defendants been made.

As a matter of law, to prevail on a defamation claim against a public
official a plaintiff must do more than propound potential avenues of
investigation that a defendant might have pursued. "[M]ere proof of
failure to investigate, without more, cannot establish reckless
disregard for the truth." [*Gertz v. Robert Welch*][gertz] (US 1974), 

> Rather, a public figure defamation plaintiff must show either that the
publisher actually entertained serious doubts about the veracity of the
publication, or that there are '*obvious* reasons to doubt the veracity
of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.'"&hellip; 

There is nothing in the record tending to show that the filmmakers
questioned Hauser's credentials or his book in any respect at the time
"Missing" was made. The record is to the contrary. The filmmakers met
with Hauser, went over his investigation and sources, supplied him with
drafts of the script under preparation and were satisfied that there was
no reason to doubt his work. No evidence whatever challenges those
facts. Certainly the filmmakers obtained no knowledge contradicting the
veracity or accuracy of Hauser's book and the stories of the Hormans as
told to them and reflected in the book. There is no suggestion to the
contrary from any provable sources. Indeed, nothing in plaintiff's
papers demonstrates that either Hauser's credentials or his book, which
was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, are in fact "suspect" in any way.

The filmmakers knew that Hauser was a lawyer who had served as a
judicial clerk in the Chambers of a Federal Judge and then worked for a
prestigious Wall Street law firm. They knew that Hauser interviewed
Captain Ray Davis, as well as other United States officials in Chile and
numerous other persons when preparing *Execution.* The filmmakers also
knew that no legal action whatsoever was taken against the book in the
approximately four years since its publication. In an August 1980
meeting where Costa-Gavras, the film's director, and Stewart, the
co-scriptwriter, met with Hauser to verify the accuracy of his book,
Hauser described his meticulous research methods and broad inquiries.
There is no evidence to the contrary.

The filmmakers then met with Charles Horman's parents, his wife, and one
Terry Simon, a close friend who was in Chile with Charles around the
time of his disappearance. Each of these individuals made clear to
Costa-Gavras and Stewart that Hauser's book accurately and reliably
depicted events as they knew and believed them. There is no evidence
that any of defendants' further research and review of documents
 regarding Horman and events in Chile during the coup caused
them to doubt the veracity of Hauser's book.

Plaintiff argues that an effective search of Hauser's background would
have disclosed "fraudulent letters" sent by Hauser to political figures
and The New York Times. This allusion is to Hauser's political satires
where he had written on public issues to officials in the voice of a
nine-year old boy, "Martin Bear." The New York Times, in fact, solicited
from Hauser and published on its "op-ed" page one of these satirical
pieces, which can hardly be reason to "suspect" the veracity of his
book.

In any event, plaintiff has neither presented nor designated specific
facts suggesting or from which it could be reasonably inferred and found
that defendants entertained serious doubts as to Hauser's account or
that there were obvious reasons to doubt the veracity or accuracy of
Hauser's book. Absent such evidence, reliance on *Execution* is not
evidence of actual malice. [*Herbert v. Lando*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16697660620075994229) (plaintiff must show either that publisher "entertained serious doubts"
or "obvious reasons" to doubt source). [*St. Amant*][amant] ("[R]eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published or would have investigated before publishing.")

#### C. *Failure to Consult Plaintiff Prior to Making Film*

Plaintiff argues that defendant's failure to consult plaintiff
personally prior to presentation of the film is evidence of actual
malice.

However, plaintiff cannot prove actual malice merely by asserting that a publisher failed to contact the subject of his work. *See* [*Vandenburg v. Newsweek, Inc.* (5th Cir. 1975)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6613184420209694118) (failure to verify story with plaintiff prior to publication insufficient evidence of actual malice.).

The actual malice standard cannot be satisfied by evidence of a
failure to check with third parties prior to publication without proof
that a publisher knew his publication was false, entertained serious
doubts as to its truth, or had obvious reasons to doubt the veracity or
accuracy of the source of published information. *See* [*New York Times
v. Sullivan*][sullivan] (and others). 

While "verification of facts" of a story with its subjects and with
others is a desirable and responsible practice and "an important
reporting standard, a reporter, without a 'high degree of awareness of
their probable falsity,' may rely on statements made by a single source
even though they reflect only one side of the story without fear of
libel prosecution.&hellip;" [*New York Times v. Connor* (5th
Cir. 1966)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7290867114825816634). 

Plaintiff has not designated specific facts suggesting an awareness or
even suspicion by defendants of probable falsity of their source
material.

#### D. *Scenes in "Missing" as Evidence Of Actual Malice*

Plaintiff enumerates nine scenes in "Missing" which the filmmakers
allegedly created, or in which they distorted the context, or made
baseless suggestions. None of these scenes provides or contributes to
the requisite evidence of actual malice.

It should be made clear that "Missing" is not a documentary, but a
dramatization of the Horman disappearance and search. The film does not
purport to depict a chronology of the events precisely as they actually
occurred; it opens with the prologue: "This film is *based on* a true
story. The incidents and facts are documented. Some of the names have
been changed to protect the innocent and also to protect the film."
(emphasis supplied). No one challenged the accuracy and veracity of
Hauser's book to the knowledge of defendants. Defendants concede that
although the substance of the film's scenes is extracted almost directly
from Thomas Hauser's book, not  everything in their film is
literally faithful to the actual historical record as if in a
documentary. That is not to say that which was not historical was set
out in bad faith, portrayed with actual malice, or established or
increased the defamatory impact.

The film is not a documentary. A documentary is a non-fictional story or
series of historical events portrayed in their actual location; a film
of real people and real events as they occur. A documentary maintains
strict fidelity to fact.

"Missing," on the other hand, is an art form sometimes described as
"Docu-Drama." The line separating a documentary from a docudrama is not
always sharply defined, but is nonetheless discernible. Both forms are
necessarily selective, given the time constraints of movies and the
attention span of the viewing audience. The docudrama is a dramatization
of an historical event or lives of real people, using actors or
actresses. Docudramas utilize simulated dialogue, composite characters,
and a telescoping of events occurring over a period into a composite
scene or scenes. This treatment is singularly appropriate and
unexceptionable if the context is not distorted when dealing with public
and political figures.

Self-evidently a docudrama partakes of author's license — it is a
creative interpretation of reality — and if alterations of fact in
scenes portrayed are not made with serious doubts of truth of the
essence of the telescoped composite, such scenes do not ground a charge
of actual malice.

Each scene questioned by the plaintiff is a telescoped composite of
events, personalities, and of the American representatives in Chile who
are involved therein. Each uses permissible literary license to fit
historical detail into a suitable dramatic context. Such dramatic
embellishments as are made do not distort the fundamental story being
told — the frantic search by his family for a missing man who has
suddenly disappeared, their emotions, anxieties, impatience,
frustration, and doubts of assistance from American officialdom. The
scenes are thus a hybrid of fact and fiction which however do not
materially distort the analysis. Always to be remembered is that they
fairly represent the source materials for the film believed to be true
by the filmmakers. Leeway is properly afforded to an author who thus
attempts to recount a true event.

As a matter of law, the dramatic overlay supplied by the film does not
serve to increase the impact of what plaintiff charges as defamatory
since it fairly and reasonably portrays the unassailable beliefs of the
Hormans, the record thereof in the Hauser book, and the corroborative
results of the authors' inquiries. In docudrama, minor fictionalization
cannot be considered evidence or support for the requirement of actual
malice.

The nine scenes selected by plaintiff as support for the requirement of
actual malice do no such thing. Each is related solely and
unquestionably to the theme of this film. The movie's Ray Tower
character is a fictional composite of the American presence operating in
Chile at the time. He is a symbolic figure. The artistic input in the
scenes questioned is found in permissible syntheses and composite
treatment in the film. Although in actuality particular individuals were
not physically present when certain dialogue occurred, in the movie
scene the composite character portrayed was.

The content of the film reflects what happened according to the book,
the persons who complained, and the sources relied on by defendants.
While the actual persons involved in the events portrayed do not appear
in on-scene interviews to describe their experiences, actions, and
motivations, the real names of some individuals are employed. But the
name Ray Davis is never mentioned. Real life personalities are
accordingly represented by telescoped composites in many
instances.

The cases on point demonstrate that the First Amendment protects such
dramatizations and does not demand literal truth in every episode
depicted; publishing a dramatization is not of itself evidence of actual
malice.

In [*Street v. National Broadcasting Co.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4559741824903610057), 
(6th Cir. 1981), the Court of Appeals affirmed a ruling on a directed verdict that the
dramatization embodied in defendant's broadcast program on the
Scottsboro rape trial was protected by the [*New York Times v.
Sullivan*][sullivan] standard, and not chargeable with actual malice. While the dramatization
 contained certain literal falsehoods, including undocumented
statements and conversations &hellip; the movie was based "in all material respects" on the Judge's findings in the Scottsboro case, and a book by a historian documenting the
Scottsboro trial. *Id.* at 1237. 

> Such techniques do not rise to the constitutional level of clear and
> convincing showing of reckless disregard &hellip; Deviations from or
> embellishments upon the information obtained from the primary sources
> relied upon were miniscule and can be attributed to the leeway
> afforded an author who attempts to recount and popularize an historic
> event."

[*Hotchner v. Castillo-Puche*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15961362284476302575) (2d Cir. 1977). Defendant published a book which purported to quote derogatory remarks
by Ernest Hemingway about plaintiff. Defendant did not print the literal
words used by Hemingway, and "was fictionalizing to some extent."
[*Hotchner*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15961362284476302575).
The Court of Appeals held that such fictionalization or dramatization
does not satisfy the requirement of clear and convincing evidence from
which a jury might reasonably find that defendant published the alleged
libel with actual malice. Actual malice could not be inferred because
"the change did not increase the defamatory impact or alter the
substantive content" of Hemingway's original statement which defendants
relied upon. *Id.*

#### *Conclusion*

The issue on the motion is not the truth of whether Davis (qua Ray
Tower) ordered or approved a Chilean order to kill Charles Horman
because he "knew too much" about alleged American involvement in the
Chilean coup; the issue is whether the filmmakers intentionally
portrayed such a defamatory suggestion, knowing that it was false or
with serious doubts of its truth. There is no doubt that Ed Horman, the
father of the missing man, asserted such a theory and that assertion is
documented in Hauser's book. Plaintiff has not presented evidence that
defendants knew the theory of the father was false, or entertained
serious doubts as to its truth. There is no evidence that defendants
acted with actual malice or disbelieved what the Hormans thought and
said or what Hauser wrote.

In sum, returning to the *ratio decidendi;* no provable, clear and
convincing, affirmative evidence nor specific facts showing actual
malice on the part of the defendants in publishing the alleged
defamation have been shown, and the complaint by plaintiff, a public
figure, falls as not sustainable under the law.

The complaint is dismissed, with costs.

SO ORDERED.

### APPENDIX

The plaintiff has designated the following nine scenes in the film
purportedly as the evidence he has that defendants published the film
with actual malice.

#### 1. *Initial Embassy Scene*

The scene depicts a meeting where it is reported that Tower and his
staff have conducted interviews in the area where Charles was last seen.
Tower states he is having dinner with the Junta's chief-of-staff Admiral
Huidobro, implying close connections with the Chilean military, and asks
Beth Horman for a list of Charles' friends which was refused.

Every element in the dramatized scene is traceable to an actual fact
about or statement by Ray Davis derived from Hauser's book. The book
establishes that Ray Davis  was in charge of the American
investigation into Charles Horman's disappearance.

#### 2. *The Hotel Meeting*

The film depicts a meeting at the Hormans' hotel at which Putnam, Clay,
and Tower are present. Clay states that a fingerprint check made at all
the morgues came up negative in the search for Horman's whereabouts and
that Captain Tower checked them himself.

The book describes the fingerprint report by governmental officials, and
this scene is a composite of those who checked on the morgue and the
fingerprints. *Execution* chronicles Ray Davis' statements that he made
inquiries with friends in the Chilean military and was checking "all
possible leads."

#### 3. *The Stadium*

In this scene the language is taken straight from *Execution;* the scene
indicates that Tower and Putnam accompany Ed and Beth Horman to the
National Stadium to search for Charles. American official presence at
the stadium, including the suggestion that Davis was involved in the
investigation into Charles' disappearance, are clearly indicated in
Hauser's account. Indeed, *Execution* portrays that Ray Davis was "in
charge of the investigation."

#### 4. *The Final Embassy Meeting*

In this scene Ed Horman tells Tower and the Embassy officials that he does not think that the military would kill Charles "unless an American official co-signed a kill order" and further indicates that he believes that American officials knew from the start that Charles was dead. These statements by Horman in the film directly reflect his beliefs as described in Hauser's book and as known to the filmmakers.

#### 5. *The Airport Scene*

In this scene Ed Horman tells Putnam, with Tower standing nearby, "I'm
gonna sue you, Phil, and Tower and the Ambassador, and everybody who let
that boy die." While the locale for this confrontation is not placed at
an airport by *Execution,* the speech accurately depicts Ed Horman's
state of mind as described in *Execution.* Horman did sue eleven
government officials.

#### 6. *The Bathroom Scene*

This scene shows Beth Horman in the bathtub at Tower's house when Tower
walks into the bathroom with a drink in his hand. Tower says, "You know,
if I were you, I'd quit living in the past. I think it's about time you
started thinking about your future." Tower exhorts Beth to "stay ahead
of the power curve" as Beth quickly exits the room.

Each of these events is taken almost directly from Hauser's book.
According to Costa-Gavras' affidavit, Joyce Horman told Costa-Gavras
that the book's description of events at Ray Davis's home was actually
understated and overly charitable to Davis, both in describing how much
he had to drink and in detailing precisely what occurred when he entered
her bathroom.

#### 7. *The Meeting with Paris*

In this scene, Paris, described as a desperate former employee of the
Junta, tells Ed Horman that a friend was present and saw Charles
detained at the Ministry of Defense in the office of Chilean General
Lutz, after he was arrested. According to the friend, an American
official was present in the office when the decision was made that the
prisoner "must 'disappear'" because "he knew too much." Paris could not
identify the American official but noted that, "The ministry is full of
them. Their Milgroup office is just down the hall from the General."

This scene is taken directly from Hauser's book, which describes in
detail the allegations of a Chilean defector and former employee of the
Chilean Intelligence Service, Rafael Gonzalez.

#### 8. *The Mafia Speech*

Tower analogizes Charles' death with the murder of someone who becomes
involved with the Mafia. In fact, plaintiff Ray Davis himself made such
a statement and this is documented in *Execution.* Interestingly, these
statements were made by Davis to Thomas Hauser while the latter was
researching his book.

#### 9. *The Telephone Repair Scene*

This scene contains the suggestion that Ed Horman's telephone at his
hotel is wiretapped. A telephone repairman leaves the hotel room and Ed
Horman tells him there was nothing wrong with the phone, and Beth is
portrayed as saying, "hello Ray Tower, how's every little thing."

*Execution* documents the incident with Ed Horman's clear impression
that either the Chilean government or American officials had bugged his
phone.

### Public Figures <a name="public_figures"></a>

Most defamation and privacy cases deal early on with the issue of whether plaintiff is a public or a private figure. In struggling with these question, courts have discussed at least three varieties of public figures.

1. General-purpose public figures;
2. Limited-purpose public figures;
3. Involuntary public figures.

#### General Purpose Public Figures.

These are easy to spot, as the D.C. Circuit put it in 
[*Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=90016016899445152060):

> A general public figure is a well-known "celebrity," 
> his name a "household word." 
> The public recognizes him and follows his words and deeds, 
> either because it regards his ideas, conduct, or judgment 
> as worthy of the attention 
> or because he actively pursues that consideration.

#### Limited-Purpose Public Figure

In its leading opinion on public *figures*, [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (US 1974)][gertz], as opposed to public *officials*, [*New York Times v. Sullivan* (US 1968)][sullivan], the United States Supreme Court identified at least two kinds of public figures:

> In some instances 
> an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety 
> that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. 
> More commonly, an *individual voluntarily injects himself 
> or is drawn into a particular public controversy 
> and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues*. 
> In either case 
> such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions.

> Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects of his life. It is preferable to reduce the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.

The states and federal circuits have developed different tests for deciding whether and when a person is a limited-purpose public figure. The Fifth Circuit uses a three-part test:

1. The controversy at issue must be public both in the sense that people are discussing it and people other than the immediate participants in the controversy are likely to feel the impact of its resolution;
2. The plaintiff must have more than a trivial or tangential role in the controversy; and,
3. The alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy.

The Second Circuit uses a four-factor inquiry, which focuses on plaintiff's participation in the public controversy. This test requires the defendant to prove that plaintiff:

1. Successfully invited public attention to his views in an effort to influence others prior to the incident that is the subject of litigation;
2. Voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy related to the subject of the litigation; 
3. Assumed a position of prominence in the public controversy; and
4. Maintained regular and continuing access to the media.

[*Lerman v. Flynt Distrib, Co.* (2d Cir. 1984)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18352275970631466991).

Other circuits use a three-part test, 
like the one the D.C. Circuit used most recently in *Kahn v. Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.* (2d Cir. 2017).
To determine if Kahl, a tax protester, was a limited purpose public figure, 
the D.C. Circuit said that:

1. First, the court must identify the relevant controversy and determine whether it is a public controversy.
2. Second, the plaintiff must have played a significant role in that controversy. 
3. Third, the defamatory statement must be germane to the plaintiff’s participation in the controversy.

DC Circuit Discusses “Limited Purpose” Public Figures
By Anthony B. Cavender
Posted May 16, 2017

The plaintiff in *Street v. NBC* (below) is a textbook example of a public figure for a limited purpose. 

#### Involuntary Public Figures

Some read [*Gertz*][gertz] as identifying yet a third variety of public figure, the involuntary public figure, based upon the Court's observation that:

> Hypothetically, it may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own, *but the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare.* For the most part those who attain this status have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes. More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, they invite attention and comment.

These distinction in the small number of cases discussing involuntary public figures seems to turn on whether the plaintiff voluntary sought to play a public role in the controversy that gave rise to her notoriety. Modern commentators suggest that even vigorous use of social media (Twitter, Facebook, and the like) could be used as evidence of one's public figure status.

### *Street v. National Broadcasting Co.*

###### (6th Circuit 1981)

* [Case in Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=4559741824903610057&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
* [Case in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadcasting_Co._v._United_States)
* [Case in Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=319+U.S.+190&appflag=67.12)

This is a Tennessee diversity case against the National Broadcasting Company for libel and invasion of privacy. The plaintiff-appellant, Victoria Price Street, was the prosecutrix and main witness in the famous rape trials of the Scottsboro boys, which occurred in Alabama more than forty years ago. NBC televised a play or historical drama
entitled "Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys," dramatizing the role of the local presiding judge in one of those trials.

The movie portrays Judge Horton as a courageous and tragic figure struggling to bring justice in a tense community gripped by racial prejudice and intent on vengeance against nine blacks accused of raping two white women. In the movie Judge Horton sets aside a jury verdict of
guilty because he believes that the evidence shows that the prosecutrix — plaintiff in this action — falsely accused the Scottsboro defendants. The play portrays the plaintiff in the derogatory light that Judge Horton apparently viewed her: as a woman attempting to send nine
innocent blacks to the electric chair for a rape they did not commit.

This case presents the question of what tort and First Amendment principles apply to an historical drama that allegedly defames a living person who participated in the historical events portrayed. The plaintiff's case is based on principles of libel law and "false light" invasion of privacy arising from the derogatory portrayal. NBC raises alternative claims and defenses: (1) the claim that the published material is not defamatory; (2) the claim of truth; (3) the common law privilege of fair comment; (4) the common law privilege of fair report on a judicial proceeding; (5) the First Amendment claim that
because the plaintiff is a public figure recovery must be based on a showing of malice; and (6) even if the malice standard is inapplicable, the claim that recovery must be based on a showing of negligence.

At the end of all the proof, District Judge Neese directed a verdict for defendant on the ground that even though plaintiff was not a public figure at the time of publication the defamatory matter was not negligently published. We affirm for the reason that the historical  events and persons portrayed are "public" as distinguished from "private." A malice standard applies to public figures under the First Amendment, and there is no evidence that the play was published with malice.

### I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

In April 1931, nine black youths were accused of raping two young white women while riding a freight train between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama. The case was widely discussed in the local, national, and foreign press. The youths were quickly tried in Scottsboro, Alabama, and all were found guilty and sentenced to death. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the convictions. 

The United States Supreme Court reversed all convictions on the ground that the defendants were denied the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. The defendants were retried separately after a change of venue from
Scottsboro to Decatur, Alabama. Patterson was the first defendant retried, and this trial was the subject of the NBC production. In a jury trial before Judge Horton, he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Judge Horton set the verdict aside on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. Patterson and one other defendant, Norris,
were then tried before another judge on essentially the same evidence, convicted, and sentenced to death. The judge let the verdicts stand, and the convictions were affirmed by the Alabama Supreme Court. 

The United States Supreme Court again reversed, this time because blacks were systematically excluded from grand and petit juries. At his fourth retrial, Patterson was convicted and sentenced to seventy-five years in prison. 
Defendants Weems and Andrew Wright were also convicted on retrial and sentenced to a term of years. Defendant Norris was convicted and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the Alabama governor. Defendants Montgomery, Roberson, Williams, and Leroy Wright were released without retrial. Powell pled guilty to assault allegedly committed during an attempted escape. The last Scottsboro defendant was paroled in 1950.

The Scottsboro case aroused strong passions and conflicting opinions in the 1930s throughout the nation. Several all white juries convicted the Scottsboro defendants of rape. Two trial judges and the Alabama Supreme Court, at times by divided vote, let these verdicts stand. Judge Horton was the sole trial judge to find the facts in favor of the defendants. Liberal opinion supported Judge Horton's conclusions that the Scottsboro
defendants had been falsely accused.

During the lengthy course of the Scottsboro trials, newspapers frequently wrote about Victoria Price. She gave some interviews to the press. Thereafter, she disappeared from public view. The Scottsboro trials and her role in them continued to be the subject of public discussion, but there is no evidence that Mrs. Street sought publicity. NBC incorrectly stated in the movie that she was no longer living. After the first showing of "Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys," plaintiff notified NBC that she was living, and shortly thereafter she filed suit. Soon after plaintiff filed suit, NBC rebroadcast the dramatization
omitting the statement that plaintiff was no longer living.

#### The Dramatization

The script for "Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys" was based on one chapter of a book by Dr. Daniel Carter, an historian, entitled *Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South*. The movie is based almost entirely on the information in Dr. Carter's book, which, in turn, was based on Judge Horton's findings at the 1933 trial, the transcript of the trial, contemporaneous newspaper reports of the trial, and interviews with Judge Horton and others. NBC purchased the movie from an independent producer.

Plaintiff's major libel and invasion of privacy claims are based on nine scenes in the movie in which she is portrayed in a derogatory light. The essential facts concerning these claims are as follows:

1. After an opening prologue, black and white youths are shown fighting on a train.  The train is halted, and the blacks are arrested. The next scene shows plaintiff standing next to Ruby Bates at the tracks. Plaintiff claims that this scene, in effect, makes her a perjurer because she testified at the 1933 trial and in this case that she fainted while alighting from the train and did not regain consciousness until she was taken to a local grocery store. Judge Horton, in his opinion sustaining the motion for a new trial, found that the observations of other witnesses and the testimony of the examining
doctor contradicted her testimony in this respect. Horton concluded that it was unlikely that Victoria Price had fainted.

2. As plaintiff and Ruby Bates are led away from the tracks by the sheriff and his men, the sheriff in the play calls the two women a "couple of bums." There is no indication in Judge Horton's opinion, in the 1933 trial transcript, or in Dr. Carter's book that this comment was
actually made.

3. In a pretrial conversation between two lawyers representing the defendant, the play portrays one of them as advising restraint in the cross-examination of plaintiff Price. He says to the other defense lawyer: "The Scottsboro transcripts are really clear .... The defense at the last trial made one thing very clear, Victoria was a *whore,* and they got it in the neck for it ...." (Emphasis added.) There is no evidence that this specific conversation between the two defense lawyers actually occurred. Dr. Carter does state in his book that one of the purposes of the defense in cross-examining plaintiff was to discredit her testimony by introducing evidence that she was a common prostitute.
*Scottsboro* at 206.

4. Plaintiff in this action contends that the movie falsely portrays her as defensive and evasive during her direct and cross-examination. 

5. Plaintiff claims that the last question put to her on
cross-examination in the play is inaccurate. In the movie the defense attorney asks: "One more question: have you ever heard of a white woman being arrested for perjury when she was the complaining witness against Negroes in the entire history of the state of Alabama?" According to the 1933 trial transcript, the actual question was, "I want to ask you if you have ever heard of any single white woman ever being locked up in jail when she is the complaining witness against Negroes in the history of the state of Alabama?" Plaintiff objects to the insertion of the word "perjury" in the play.

6. In the play, Dr. Marvin Lynch, one of the doctors who examined plaintiff after she alighted from the train, approaches Judge Horton outside the courtroom and confides that he does not believe that the two women were raped by the Scottsboro boys. Dr. Lynch refuses to go on the
witness stand and so testify, however. Plaintiff argues that this scene is improper because it is not supported in the 1933 trial record. This is true. Neither the 1933 trial transcript nor Judge Horton's opinion make reference to this incident. The Carter book does state, however,
that Judge Horton told the author in a later interview that this incident occurred. *Scottsboro* at 214-15.

7. The play portrays events leading up to plaintiff's trip to Chattanooga with her friend, Ruby Bates. It was on the return trip to Alabama that the rape alleged occurred. Lester Carter, a defense witness in the play, testifies that he had intercourse with Ruby Bates on the night before the trip to Chattanooga and that plaintiff had intercourse with Jack Tiller. During the testimony there is a flashback that shows an exchange in a boxcar in which Ruby Bates suggests that they all go to Chattanooga  and plaintiff says, "[m]aybe Ruby and me could hustle there while you two [Carter and Tiller] got some kind of fill-in
work. What do you say?" This is an accurate abridgement of the substance of the actual testimony of Lester Carter at the 1933 trial, although Price denied, both at the 1933 trial and in the defamation trial below, that she had had intercourse with Tiller. Judge Horton specifically
found that she did not tell the truth. The dramatization quoted or closely paraphrased substantial portions of Judge Horton's 1933 opinion. 

8. Lester Carter also testifies in the play that plaintiff urged him to say that he had seen her raped. The 1933 trial transcript reveals that Carter actually testified that he overheard plaintiff tell another white youth that "if you don't testify according to what I testify I will see that you are took off the witness stand.&hellip;" Judge Horton in his opinion observed that there was evidence presented at the trial showing that Price encouraged others to support her version of what had happened.

9. Another witness in the play, Dallas Ramsey, testifies that he saw plaintiff and Ruby Bates in a "hobo jungle" near the train tracks in Chattanooga the night before the train trip back to Alabama. Ramsey testifies that plaintiff stated that she and her husband were looking
for work and that "her old man" was uptown scrounging for food. The play dramatizes Ramsey's testimony while he is on the stand by a flashback to the scene at the "hobo jungle." The flashback gives the impression that
plaintiff is perhaps inviting sexual advances from Ramsey, although the words used do not state this specifically. The substance of Ramsey's testimony, as portrayed in the play, is found in the 1933 trial transcript. The record provides no basis for the suggestive flashback.

### II. COMMON LAW CLAIMS AND DEFENSES

#### A. Defamatory Nature of the Published Material

Taken as a whole, the play conveys a defamatory image of the plaintiff. Although the words "bum" and "hustle" may be considered rhetorical hyperbole and therefore not necessarily defamatory, [*Letter Carriers v. Austin,* (US 1974),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=923744859423605953) the reference to plaintiff as a "whore" and her portrayal as a perjurer and a suborner of perjury is obviously defamatory. The suggestive flashbacks showing her inviting sexual advances of Ramsey and Tiller reinforce the defamation. The effect of the drama as a whole is to create a character, Victoria Price. She is portrayed as a loose woman who falsely accuses the Scottsboro boys of raping her. This image of her character is created throughout the play by her own words and actions in the  flashbacks and in the witness chair and by what others say about her.

#### B. The Privilege of Fair Comment

The portrayal of Victoria Price in this way is not expressed in the play as a matter of opinion. The characterization is expressed as concrete fact. The common law privilege of fair comment, adopted in Tennessee 
&hellip; is now protected as opinion under the First Amendment, [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,* (US 1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202).
But this play does not say to the viewer that this is NBC's opinion about the character and actions of Victoria Price. It shows her inviting sexual intercourse and swearing falsely. We do not believe this characterization fits within the traditional fair comment privilege
protecting opinion. *See* [*Cianci v. New York Times Publishing Co.,* (2nd Cir. 1980, *as amended* Oct. 27, 1980)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15742491952572175828&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(magazine article interpreting evidence of rape not expression of
opinion).

#### C. The Defense of Truth and the Privilege of Fair Report of a Judicial Proceeding

In his opinion setting aside the verdict, Judge Horton found, in effect, that NBC's characterization of Victoria Price was true. The movie characterizes her as Judge Horton found the facts in his opinion. This does not mean, however, that the case should be withdrawn from the jury on the basis of the defense of truth or the privilege of fair report of a judicial proceeding.

Neither Judge Horton's findings nor the final convictions based on the testimony of Victoria Price and affirmed on appeal settle the question of truth. That still remains an open question. Technical doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not apply in this context. Neither Victoria Price nor NBC were parties in the 1930s trials. In addition, citizens obviously have a right to attack the fairness of a trial. Judicial proceedings resolve disputes, but they do not establish the truth for all time. In libel cases the question of truth is normally
one for the jury in a defamation action.

Many of the scenes actually quote or paraphrase the trial transcript, but the movie is not a completely accurate report of the trial. Witnesses who corroborate Victoria Price's version of the facts are omitted. The portions of the original trial that show her as a perjurer and a promiscuous woman are emphasized. The flashbacks consistently show plaintiff's conduct in a derogatory light. The flashbacks entirely accept the theory of the case presented by Judge Horton and the defense and reject the theory of the case presented by the state and the plaintiff. Under such circumstances the common law privilege permitting publication of defamatory material as a part of a fair and accurate report on judicial proceedings is not satisfied. The element of balance and neutrality is missing. 

### III. THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSES

#### A. Plaintiff was a Public Figure During the Scottsboro Trials

Since common law defenses do not support the directed verdict for NBC,
we must reach the constitutional issues, particularly the question
whether plaintiff should be characterized as a "public figure." In
*Gertz,* the Supreme Court held that one characterized as a "public
figure," as distinguished from a private individual, "may recover for
injury to reputation *only on clear and convincing proof* that the
defamatory falsehood was made *with knowledge of its falsity or with
reckless disregard for the truth.*" [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202)
(emphasis added). In balancing the need to protect "private
personality" and reputation  against the need "to assure to
the freedoms of speech and press that 'breathing space' essential to
their free exercise," the Supreme Court has developed a general test to
determine public figure status.

*Gertz* establishes a two-step analysis to determine if an individual is
a public figure. First, does a "public controversy" exist? Second, what
is "the nature and extent of [the] individual's participation" in that
public controversy? [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Three factors determine the "nature and extent" of an individual's
involvement: the extent to which participation in the controversy is
voluntary, the extent to which there is access to channels of effective
communication in order to counteract false statements, and the
prominence of the role played in the public controversy. [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

The Supreme Court has not clearly defined the elements of a "public controversy." It is evident that it is not simply any controversy of general or public interest. Not all judicial proceedings are public controversies.  Several factors, however, lead to the conclusion that the Scottsboro case is the kind of public controversy referred to in *Gertz.* The Scottsboro trials were the focus of major public debate over the ability of our courts to render even-handed justice. It generated widespread press and attracted public attention for several years. It was also a contributing factor in changing public attitudes about the right of black citizens to equal treatment under law and in changing constitutional principles governing the right to counsel and the exclusion of blacks from the jury.

The first factor in determining the nature and extent of plaintiff's
participation is the prominence of her role in the public controversy.
She was the only alleged victim, and she was the major witness for the
State in the prosecution of the nine black youths. Ruby Bates, the other
young woman who earlier had testified against the defendants, later
recanted her incriminating testimony. Plaintiff was left as the sole
prosecutrix. Therefore, she played a prominent role in the public
controversy.

The second part of the test of public figure status is also met.
Plaintiff had "access to the channels of effective communication and
hence ... a ... realistic opportunity to counteract false statements."
[*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202).
The evidence indicates that plaintiff recognized her importance to the
criminal trials and the interest of the public in her as a personality.
The press clamored to interview her. She clearly had access to the media
and was able to broadcast her view of the events.

The most troublesome issue is whether plaintiff "voluntarily" "thrust"
herself to the forefront of this public controversy. It cannot be said
that a rape victim "voluntarily" injects herself into a criminal
prosecution for rape. *See* [*Time, Inc. v. Firestone*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12685855173622583678) (US 1976).
In such an instance, voluntariness in the legal sense is closely bound
to the issue of truth. If she was raped, her participation in the
initial legal proceedings was involuntary for the purpose of determining
her public figure status; if she falsely accused the defendants, her
participation in this controversy was "voluntary." But legal standards
in libel cases should not be drawn so that either the courts or the
press must first determine the issue of truth before they can determine
whether an individual should be treated as a public or a private figure.
The principle of libel law should not be drawn in such a way that it
forces the press, in an uncertain public controversy, to guess correctly
about a woman's chastity.

When the issue of truth and the issue of voluntariness are the same, it
is necessary to determine the public figure status of the individual
without regard to whether she "voluntarily" thrust herself in the
forefront of the public controversy. If  there were no
evidence of voluntariness other than that turning on the issue of truth,
we would not consider the fact of voluntariness. In such a case, the
other factors — prominence and access to media — alone would determine
public figure status. But in this case, there is evidence of
voluntariness not bound up with the issue of truth. Plaintiff gave press
interviews and aggressively promoted her version of the case outside of
her actual courtroom testimony. In the context of a widely-reported,
intense public controversy concerning the fairness of our criminal
justice system, plaintiff was a public figure under *Gertz* because she
played a major role, had effective access to the media and encouraged
public interest in herself.

#### B. Plaintiff Remains a Public Figure 

The Supreme Court has explicitly reserved the question of "whether or
when an individual who was once a public figure may lose that status by
the passage of time." [*Wolston v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14330147117680431779)  (US 1979).
In *Wolston* the District of Columbia Circuit found that plaintiff was a
public figure and retained that status for the purpose of later
discussion of the espionage case in which he was called as a witness.
The Supreme Court found that the plaintiff's role in the original public
controversy was so minor that he was not a public figure. It therefore
reserved the question of whether a person retains his public figure
status.

Plaintiff argues that even if she was a public figure at the time of the
1930s trial, she lost her public figure status over the intervening
forty years. We reject this argument and hold that once a person becomes
a public figure in connection with a particular controversy, that person
remains a public figure thereafter for purposes of later commentary or
treatment of *that controversy.* This rule finds support in both case
law and analysis of the constitutional malice standard.

On this issue the Fifth Circuit has reached the same conclusion as the
District of Columbia Circuit in *Wolston.* In [*Brewer v. Memphis
Publishing Co., Inc.,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3470754345585952877&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (5th Cir. 1980).
plaintiff sued when a newspaper implied that she was reviving a
long-dormant romantic relationship with Elvis Presley. The Fifth Circuit
concluded that although the passage of time might narrow the range of
topics protected by a malice standard, plaintiff remained a public
figure when the defendant commented on her romantic relationship. The
court noted that plaintiff's name continued to be connected with Presley
even after her retirement from show business.

Other courts have assumed *sub silentio* that the public figure status
was retained over the passage of time. *See, e. g.,* [*Meeropol v. Nizer,* (2d Cir. 1977),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15243536244801528103&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
*cert. denied,* [(US 1978)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=1891215749533979497&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(having spent most of their early years in limelight, sons of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg are public figures for purposes of subsequent commentary
on Rosenberg trials). Some courts have relied on a pre-*Gertz*
"newsworthiness" analysis to support a finding that the passage of time
did not alter the standard of liability. 

Our nation depends on "robust debate" to determine the best answer to
public controversies of this sort. The public figure
doctrine makes it possible for publishers to provide information on such
issues to the debating public, undeterred by the threat of liability
except in cases of actual malice. Developed in the context
of contemporaneous reporting, the doctrine promotes a forceful exchange
of views.

Considerations that underlie the public figure doctrine in the context
of contemporaneous reporting also apply to later historical or dramatic
treatment of the same events. Past public figures who now live in
obscurity do not lose their access to channels of communication if they
choose to comment on their role in the past public controversy. And
although the publisher of history does not operate under journalistic
deadlines it generally makes little difference in terms of accuracy and
verifiability that the events on which a publisher is reporting occurred
decades ago. Although information may come to light over the course of
time, the distance of years does not necessarily make more data
available to a reporter: memories fade; witnesses forget; sources
disappear.

There is no reason for the debate to be any less vigorous when events
that are the subject of current discussion occurred several years
earlier. The mere passage of time does not automatically diminish the
significance of events or the public's need for information. A nation
that prizes its heritage need have no illusions about its past. It is no
more fitting for the Court to constrain the analysis of past events than
to stem the tide of current news. From Alfred Dreyfus to Alger Hiss,
famous cases have been debated and reinterpreted by commentators and
historians. A contrary rule would tend to restrain efforts to shed new
light on historical events and reconsideration of past errors.

The plaintiff was the pivotal character in the most famous rape case of
the twentieth century. It became a political controversy as well as a
legal dispute. As the white prosecutrix of nine black youths during an
era of racial prejudice in the South, she aroused the attention of the
nation. The prosecutions were among the first to focus the conscience of
the nation on the question of the ability of our system of justice to
provide fair trials to blacks in the South. The question persists today.
As long as the question remains, the Scottsboro boys case will not be
relegated to the dusty pages of the scholarly treatise. It will remain a
living controversy.

#### C. Evidence Insufficient to Support Malice

A plaintiff may not recover under the malice standard unless there is
"clear and convincing proof" that the defamation was published "with
knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth."
[*Gertz,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=street+v.+national+broadcasting+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
There is no evidence that NBC had  knowledge that its
portrayal of Victoria Price was false or that NBC recklessly disregarded
the truth. The derogatory portrayal of Price in the movie is based in
all material respects on the detailed findings of Judge Horton at the
trial and Dr. Carter in his book. When the truth is uncertain and seems
undiscoverable through further investigation, reliance on these two
sources is not unreasonable.

We gain perspective on this question when we put to ourselves another
case. Dr. Carter, in his book, persuasively argues, based on the
evidence, that the Communist Party financed and controlled the defense
of the Scottsboro boys. A different playwright might choose to portray
Judge Horton as some Southern newspapers portrayed him at the time — as
an evil judge who associated himself with a Communist cause and gave his
approval to interracial rape in order to curry favor with the eastern
press. The problem would be similar had Judge Horton — for many years
before his death an obscure private citizen — sued the publisher for
libel.

Some controversial historical events like the Scottsboro trials become
symbolic and take on an overlay of political meaning. Speech about such
events becomes in part political speech. The hypothetical case and the
actual case before us illustrate that an individual's social philosophy
and political leanings color his historical perspective. His political
opinions cause him to draw different lessons from history and to see
historical events and facts in a different light. He believes the
historical evidence he wants to believe and casts aside other evidence
to the contrary. So long as there is no evidence of bad faith or
conscious or extreme disregard of the truth, the speaker in such a
situation does not violate the malice standard. His version of history
may be wrong, but the law does not punish him for being a bad historian.

The malice standard is flexible and encourages diverse political
opinions and robust debate about social issues. It tolerates silly
arguments and strange ways of yoking facts together in unusual patterns.
But it is not infinitely expandable. It does not abolish all the common
law of libel even in the political context. It still protects us against
the "big political lie," the conscious or reckless falsehood. We do not
have that in this case.

Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

## What About Other Torts?

What if instead of suing for defamation, the unhappy public figure sues for intentional infliction of emotional distress?

## *Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,*

###### United States Supreme Court (1988)

* [*Hustler v. Falwell* at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5069891851949874011).
* [*Hustler v. Falwell* at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=108+S.Ct.+876&appflag=67.12)
* [*Hustler v. Falwell* at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell). 
* [Image of the Campari ad](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/falwell/campariL.jpg).

The inside front cover of the November 1983 issue of Hustler Magazine
featured a "parody" of an advertisement for Campari Liqueur that
contained the name and picture of preacher Jerry Falwell and was entitled "Jerry
Falwell talks about his first time." This parody was modeled after
actual Campari ads that included interviews with various celebrities
about their "first times." Although it was apparent by the end of each
interview that this meant the first time they sampled Campari, the ads
clearly played on the sexual double entendre of the general subject of
"first times." Copying the form and layout of these Campari ads,
Hustler's editors chose respondent as the featured celebrity and drafted
an alleged "interview" with him in which he states that his "first time"
was during a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an
outhouse. The Hustler parody portrays respondent and his mother as drunk
and immoral, and suggests that respondent is a hypocrite who preaches
only when he is drunk. In small print at the bottom of the page, the ad
contains the disclaimer, "ad parody — not to be taken seriously." The
magazine's table of contents also lists the ad as "Fiction; Ad and
Personality Parody."

Soon after the November issue of Hustler became available to the public, Falwell sued Hustler Magazine and Larry Flynt to recover damages for libel, invasion of privacy
(celebrity/publicity rights), and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case proceeded to
trial. At the close of the evidence, the District Court
granted a directed verdict for Flynt and Hustler on the invasion of privacy (celebrity/publicity rights) claim. The jury then found against Falwell on the libel claim,
specifically finding that the ad parody could not "reasonably be
understood as describing actual facts about Falwell or actual
events in which he participated." 
The jury found for Falwell on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, 
however, and stated that he should be awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages, 
as well as $50,000 each in punitive damages from petitioners. 
Petitioners' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied.

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
affirmed &hellip; rejecting Flynt and Hustler's argument that the "actual malice"
standard of [*New York Times Co.* v. *Sullivan* (US 1964)][sullivan] 
must be met before Falwell (concededly a public figure) could recover for emotional distress.

In the Fourth Circuit's view, the *New York Times* decision emphasized the
constitutional importance not of the falsity of the statement or the
defendant's disregard for the truth, but of the heightened level of
culpability embodied in the requirement of "knowing . . . or reckless"
conduct. Here, the *New York*  *Times* standard is satisfied by
the state-law requirement, and the jury's finding, that the defendants
have acted intentionally or recklessly, and that the sole issue before the court was "whether [the ad's] publication was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional
infliction of emotional distress." 

This case presents us with a novel question involving First Amendment
limitations upon a State's authority to protect its citizens from the
intentional infliction of emotional distress. We must decide whether a
public figure may recover damages for emotional harm caused by the
publication of an ad parody offensive to him, and doubtless gross and
repugnant in the eyes of most. Falwell would have us find that a
State's interest in protecting public figures from emotional distress is
sufficient to deny First Amendment protection to speech that is patently
offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury, even when that
speech could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual
facts about the public figure involved. This we decline to do.&hellip;

Of course, this does not mean that *any* speech about a public figure is
immune from sanction in the form of damages. Since [*New York Times Co.*
v. *Sullivan* (US 1964),][sullivan] we have consistently ruled that a public figure may hold a speaker liable for the damage to reputation caused by publication of a
defamatory falsehood, but only if the statement was made "with knowledge
that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or
not." &hellip; False statements of fact are particularly
valueless; they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the
marketplace of ideas, and they cause damage to an individual's
reputation that cannot easily be repaired by counterspeech, however
persuasive or effective. See [*Gertz*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202&q=hustler+flynt&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
But even though falsehoods have little value in and of themselves, they
are "nevertheless inevitable in free debate," and a rule
that would impose strict liability on a publisher for false factual
assertions would have an undoubted "chilling" effect on speech relating
to public figures that does have constitutional value. "Freedoms of
expression require " 'breathing space.'" &hellip; This breathing space is provided by a constitutional rule that allows
public figures to recover for libel or defamation only when they can
prove *both* that the statement was false and that the statement was
made with the requisite level of culpability.

Respondent argues, however, that a different standard should apply in
this case because here the State seeks to prevent not reputational
damage, but the severe emotional distress suffered by the person who is
the subject of an offensive publication. Cf. [*Zacchini* v.
*Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.,* (US 1977)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16238771870259020023)
(ruling that the "actual malice" standard does not apply to the tort of
appropriation of a right of publicity). In respondent's view, and in the
view of the  Court of Appeals, so long as the utterance was
intended to inflict emotional distress, was outrageous, and did in fact
inflict serious emotional distress, it is of no constitutional import
whether the statement was a fact or an opinion, or whether it was true
or false. It is the intent to cause injury that is the gravamen of the
tort, and the State's interest in preventing emotional harm simply
outweighs whatever interest a speaker may have in speech of this type.

Generally speaking the law does not regard the intent to inflict
emotional distress as one which should receive much solicitude, and it
is quite understandable that most if not all jurisdictions have chosen
to make it civilly culpable where the conduct in question is
sufficiently "outrageous." But in the world of debate about public
affairs, many things done with motives that are less than admirable are
protected by the First Amendment. 
In [*Garrison* v. *Louisiana*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6463657344879720774&q=hustler+flynt&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1964), 
we held that even when a speaker or writer is motivated by hatred or ill
will his expression was protected by the First Amendment:

> "Debate on public issues will not be uninhibited if the speaker must
> run the risk that it will be proved in court that he spoke out of
> hatred; even if he did speak out of hatred, utterances honestly
> believed contribute to the free interchange of ideas and the
> ascertainment of truth." *Id.,* at 73.

Thus while such a bad motive may be deemed controlling for purposes of
tort liability in other areas of the law, we think the First Amendment
prohibits such a result in the area of public debate about public
figures.

Were we to hold otherwise, there can be little doubt that political
cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to damages awards without
any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject. Webster's
defines a caricature as "the deliberately distorted picturing or
imitating of a person, literary style, etc. by exaggerating features or
mannerisms for satirical effect." The appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on exploitation of unfortunate physical traits or politically embarrassing events — an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the subject of the portrayal. The art of the cartoonist is often not reasoned or evenhanded, but slashing and one-sided. One cartoonist
expressed the nature of the art in these words:

> "The political cartoon is a weapon of attack, of scorn and ridicule
> and satire; it is least effective when it tries to pat some politician
> on the back. It is usually as welcome as a bee sting and is always
> controversial in some quarters."

Several famous examples of this type of intentionally injurious speech
were drawn by Thomas Nast, probably the greatest American cartoonist to
date, who was associated for many years during the post-Civil War era
with Harper's Weekly. In the pages of that publication Nast conducted a
graphic vendetta against William M. "Boss" Tweed and his corrupt
associates in New York City's "Tweed Ring." It has been described by one
historian of the subject as "a sustained attack which in its passion and
effectiveness stands alone in the history of American graphic art." &hellip;
Another writer
explains that the success of the Nast cartoon was achieved "because of
the emotional impact of its presentation. It continuously goes beyond
the bounds of good taste and conventional manners."

Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon
portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic
depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public
and political debate. Nast's castigation of the Tweed Ring, Walt
McDougall's characterization of Presidential candidate James G. Blaine's
banquet with the millionaires at Delmonico's as "The Royal  Feast
of Belshazzar," and numerous other efforts have undoubtedly had an
effect on the course and outcome of contemporaneous debate. Lincoln's
tall, gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt's glasses and teeth, and
Franklin D. Roosevelt's jutting jaw and cigarette holder have been
memorialized by political cartoons with an effect that could not have
been obtained by the photographer or the portrait artist. From the
viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have
been considerably poorer without them.

Falwell contends, however, that the caricature in question here was
so "outrageous" as to distinguish it from more traditional political
cartoons. There is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his
mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political
cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were
possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from
the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But
we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite sure that the
pejorative description "outrageous" does not supply one.
"Outrageousness" in the area of political and social discourse has an
inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose
liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the
basis of their dislike of a particular expression. An "outrageousness"
standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to
be awarded because the speech in question may have an adverse emotional
impact on the audience. See [*NAACP* v. *Claiborne Hardware Co.* (US 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7271075303659098319) ("Speech does not lose its protected character. . . simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action"). 

> We conclude that public figures and public officials may not recover for
the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of
publications such as the one here at issue without showing in addition
that the publication *contains a false statement of fact* which was made
with "actual malice," *i.e.,* with knowledge that the statement was
false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true. 

For reasons heretofore stated this claim cannot, consistently with
the First Amendment, form a basis for the award of damages when the
conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad
parody involved here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
accordingly

*Reversed.*

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->

<!--

Actual malice is different from common law malice which indicates spite or ill-will. It may also differ from "actual malice" as defined in state libel law, as was confirmed in the case of Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc. (1983). Also see HERBERT v. LANDO, (1979) 441 U.S. 153 (1979)441 U.S. 153 fn 12; "The existence of actual malice may be shown in many ways. As a general rule, any competent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, can be resorted to, and all the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction may be shown, provided they are not too remote, including threats, prior or subsequent defamations, subsequent statements of the defendant, circumstances indicating the existence of rivalry, ill will, or hostility between the parties, facts tending to show a reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights..."


To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, we hold that the common-law presumption that defamatory speech is false cannot stand when a plaintiff seeks damages against a media defendant.
