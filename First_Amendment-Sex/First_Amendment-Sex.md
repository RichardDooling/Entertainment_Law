# Lawyers For The Talent

###### by Richard Dooling

## First Amendment - Sex

The First Amendment says: 

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

But as lawyers, agents and representatives working for artists, or as people who collaborate with and represent artists, we are usually not concerned about establishing religions or assembling to petition the government; we are concerned about SPEECH. So an edited version of the First Amendment for those in the entertainment industry might go like this:

> Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech. 

So much for *Congress* not making laws. Then we add the Fourteenth Amendment, which says:

> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Read together, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit *GOVERNMENTS* from making laws abridging the freedom of speech. Private parties using private, lawful means may "abridge" the speech of others without causing First Amendment problems (e.g. by firing "speakers," or boycotting their performances, or slapping an NC-17 rating on their movies, or an [ESRB][esrb] warning on their video games.) 

So always look for *STATE ACTION* first to determine if you have a First Amendment issue. The easiest way to check for state action? Look for a law (statute, ordinance, regulation), then look at the speech which supposedly violated the law. 

### What Is Speech?

In the United States, the First Amendment protects speech, but what kinds of speech? Spoken words? Printed words? Any behaviors meant to convey a message? Flag burning? Movies? Video games? Nude dancing? Child pornography? Writing a book called: *How To Make A Suitcase Nuke?*

What about slander? Isn't that speech? Or fraud, or hiring somebody to murder your spouse, or lying to an IRS agent, or soliciting a prostitute? 

The First Amendment obviously does not protect ALL speech.  Author Kurt Vonnegut once observed that: "The First Amendment reads more like a dream than a law." Indeed. So what speech does it protect? Or is it easier to ask what speech is NOT protected by the First Amendment?

If the First Amendment doesn't mean what it says, then what does it mean? Some First Amendment absolutists ask: What part of make no law is it that you don't understand? 

### What is the Purpose of the First Amendment?

Sounds like a question the professor might pose to kill twenty minutes of class time when he's unprepared to teach the next case, but the question lurks in the background of many a Supreme Court opinion. If not all speech is protected, courts often consider what the Founders meant by the simple statement: Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

Why was the First Amendment added to the Constitution in 1791? And if Congress meant what it said about passing no laws abridging the freedom of speech, why seven years later (in 1798) did Congress pass the [Alien and Sedition Acts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts) which made it a crime for anyone to publish "false, scandalous, and malicious writing against the government or its officials?"

[Eugene Volokh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Volokh) argues that the problematic words are not "make no law," but rather "the freedom of speech." In speculating on what the Founders had in mind, Volokh has this to say.

> But nearly everyone, as best I can tell, saw "freedom of speech" and "freedom of the press" as providing less than complete constitutional protection for spoken or printed words. And this suggests that the term "freedom of" referred to some understanding that there is a proper scope of such freedom (even if the scope was unsettled in some particulars), rather to unlimited freedom to say or print anything one pleases.

> It's much like, if tomorrow a state enacted a law protecting "the freedom to marry," we probably wouldn't think that it means the freedom to marry a 10-year-old, or the freedom to marry one's daughter, or (depending on the circumstances) even the freedom to marry several people at once. "The freedom to marry" would be seen as referring to a broad but not unlimited concept that is less than the freedom to marry anyone one pleases.

> Now, to be sure, during and after the controversy over the Sedition Act of 1798, some foes of the Act argued that the First Amendment did bar Congress from any authority to restrict spoken or printed words. But I'm rather skeptical that this was then or is now a sound interpretation of the constitutional text.

Do we have a First Amendment because speaking one's mind is a basic human right? Like the freedom to travel, or freedom to buy birth control? Perhaps the colonists wanted only to be certain that their new American government would be prohibited from imposing [prior restraints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_restraint) on speech, the sort of licensing schemes that inspired the poet John Milton to write [Areopagitica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica)? Maybe free speech is a kind of civic "safety valve" allowing aggrieved citizens to march in the streets or issue screeds on street corners instead of arming themselves and starting a civil war? Theories one and all that have been propounded as possible reasons we have a First Amendment.


#### The Marketplace of Ideas  

When the Supreme Court addresses these questions, they steer between two competing principles of First Amendment jurisprudence that will never be reconciled (think [Scylla and Charybdis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Scylla_and_Charybdis), a rock and a hard place, the horns of a dilemma).

One principle is called the marketplace of ideas, first formulated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who wrote:

> The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market. --Abrams v. United States (1919)

To Justice Holmes, there's no such thing as good or bad speech, only speech that competes in the Darwinian marketplace and lives or dies. The Court's job is to strike down any attempts by the government to regulate the marketplace of ideas. Of course, there are the inevitable exceptions, because Holmes was also the Justice who wrote: "The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic."

#### Civic Republicanism

Justice Louis Brandeis offered a parallel and sometimes competing principle of First Amendment theory eight years later, when he articulated what might be called the purpose of the First Amendment:

> Those who won our independence . . . believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile . . .  --Whitney v. California (1927)

See how Justice Brandeis suggests that the First Amendment does not exist to protect all speech; it exists to protect speech that leads to the discovery and spread of "political truth." Brandeis wants to protect speech, not because it's an absolute value or good for the soul, but because it's essential for democracy and civic republicanism. Quite a different concern than Justice Holmes' marketplace where it's every idea for itself and survival of the fittest. In fact, Holmes would probably say that there is no such thing as "political truth." Truth is whatever the marketplace says it is. If cat videos beat out President Obama's State of the Union address, so be it.

But a film producer or a director or an author needs an entertainment lawyer, not a con law scholar. The First Amendment is an absorbing system of case law and legal theories, but we have to get on with the business of ENTERTAINMENT.

## Are Movies Speech?

Oh, what might have been! In 1915, when the motion picture business was still in its infancy many states censored movies as a matter of course. The first time a case arguing that the "boards of censors" interfered with the First Amendment rights of people who displayed the films or wanted to see them, the United States Supreme Court said: I beg your pardon? Movies are NOT speech.

### *Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Commission of Ohio*

###### U.S. Supreme Court (1915)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7270078849202844362)
* [case on Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=35+S.Ct.+387&appflag=67.12)
* [case at Wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Film_Corporation_v._Industrial_Commission_of_Ohio) 

The state government of Ohio had passed a statute in 1913 forming a board of censors which had the duty of reviewing and approving all films intended to be exhibited in the state. The board charged a fee for the approval service. The board could order the arrest of anyone showing an unapproved film in the state.

Mutual Film Corporation, a movie distributor, argued that this licensing scheme and Ohio's censorship of movies violated its freedom of speech. 

The Supreme Court in a unanimous opinion noted the insidious power of movies to affect the sensibilities of women and children and dismissed Mutual Film's "freedom of speech" arguments without a second thought.  

> [T]he exhibition of moving pictures is a business pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit, like other spectacles, not to be regarded . . . as part of the press of the country or as organs of public opinion. They are mere representations of events, of ideas and sentiments published and known, vivid, useful and entertaining no doubt, but, as we have said, capable of evil, having power for it, the greater because of their attractiveness and manner of exhibition.

#### The Hays Code

From 1915 (the date of the *Mutual Film* decision) to 1952, the film industry embarked on zealous self regulation to ward off the welter of state censorship laws that were passed to regulate morals and movies. The infamous [Motion Picture Production Code aka the "Hays Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code) 

The code had three general principles:

1. No picture shall be produced which will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience shall never be thrown to the side of crime, wrong-doing, evil or sin.
2. Correct standards of life, subject only to the requirements of drama and entertainment, shall be presented.
3. Law, natural or human, shall not be ridiculed, nor shall sympathy be created for its violation. (From the Production Code, 1934)

The Production Code became more stringent and obnoxious to filmmakers until 1952 when a "miracle" happened.

### *Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson*

######  U.S. Supreme Court (1952)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5628256980652867975)
* [how cited at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=5628256980652867975&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28)
* [case at Westlaw][burstyn]
* [case at Wikipedia][burstyn-w]

The "miracle" took the form of the Supreme Court's next take on the question: Are movies speech? The movie in question, Roberto Rosselini's *The Miracle* starring the director Federico Fellini. 

After its American release, the New York State Board of Regents reportedly received "hundreds of letters, telegrams, postcards, affidavits and other communications" protesting or defending the film's exhibition. Three members of the Board examined the movie and concluded that *The Miracle* was "sacrilegious" and ordered the film producers to prove otherwise at a hearing. The hearing determined that the film indeed constituted religious bigotry, and the Commissioner of Education rescinded the producer's license to exhibit the picture.

Here is a summary of *The Miracle's* story, written by a reporter for the *Atlantic Monthly* and quoted in a concurring opinion in the case itself:

> A poor, simple-minded girl is tending a herd of goats on a mountainside one day, when a bearded stranger passes. Suddenly it strikes her fancy that he is St. Joseph, her favorite saint, and that he has come to take her to heaven, where she will be happy and free. While she pleads with him to transport her, the stranger gently plies the girl with wine, and when she is in a state of tumult, he apparently ravishes her. (This incident in the story is only briefly and discreetly implied.)

> The girl awakens later, finds the stranger gone, and climbs down from the mountain not knowing whether he was real or a dream. She meets an old priest who tells her that it is quite possible that she did see a saint, but a younger priest scoffs at the notion. "Materialist!" the old priest says.

> There follows now a brief sequence—intended to be symbolic, obviously—in which the girl is reverently sitting with other villagers in church. Moved by a whim of appetite, she snitches an apple from the basket of a woman next to her. When she leaves the church, a cackling beggar tries to make her share the apple with him, but she chases him away as by habit and munches the fruit contentedly.

> Then, one day, while tending the village youngsters as their mothers work at the vines, the girl faints and the women discover that she is going to have a child. Frightened and bewildered, she suddenly murmurs, "It is the grace of God!" and she runs to the church in great excitement, looks for the statue of St. Joseph, and then prostrates herself on the floor.

> Thereafter she meekly refuses to do any menial work and the housewives humor her gently but the young people are not so kind. In a scene of brutal torment, they first flatter and laughingly mock her, then they cruelly shove and hit her and clamp a basin as a halo on her head. Even abused by the beggars, the poor girl gathers together her pitiful rags and sadly departs from the village to live alone in a cave.

> When she feels her time coming upon her, she starts back towards the village. But then she sees the crowds in the streets; dark memories haunt her; so she turns towards a church on a high hill and instinctively struggles towards it, crying desperately to God. A goat is her sole companion. She drinks water dripping from a rock. And when she comes to the church and finds the door locked, the goat attracts her to a small side door. Inside the church, the poor girl braces herself for her labor pains. There is a dissolve, and when we next see her sad face, in close-up, it is full of a tender light. There is the cry of an unseen baby. The girl reaches towards it and murmurs, "My son! My love! My flesh!"

MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the court.

#### Excerpts from the *Burstyn* opinion: 

In a series of decisions beginning with [*Gitlow* v. *New York,* 268 U.  S. 652 (1925),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5505973138575755803&q=burstyn&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
this Court held that the liberty of speech and of the press which the
First Amendment guarantees against abridgment by the federal government
is within the liberty safeguarded by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action. That
principle has been  followed and reaffirmed to the present day.
Since this series of decisions came after the *Mutual* decision, the
present case is the first to present squarely to us the question whether
motion pictures are within the ambit of protection which the First
Amendment, through the Fourteenth, secures to any form of "speech" or
"the press."

It cannot be doubted that motion pictures are a significant medium for the communication of ideas. They may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of ways, ranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression. The importance of motion pictures as an organ of public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed to entertain as well as to inform. As was said in [*Winters* v. *New York,* 333 U. S. 507, 510 (1948)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16314089118204976902&q=burstyn&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0):

> "The line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right [a free press]. Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction. What is one man's amusement, teaches another's doctrine."

It is urged that motion pictures do not fall within the First Amendment's aegis because their production, distribution, and exhibition is a large-scale business conducted for private profit. We cannot agree.  That books, newspapers, and magazines are published and sold for profit does not prevent them from being a form of expression whose liberty is safeguarded by the First Amendment.  We fail to see why operation for profit should have any different effect in the
case of motion pictures.

It is further urged that motion pictures possess a greater capacity for
evil, particularly among the youth of a community, than other modes of
expression. Even if one were to accept this hypothesis, it does not
follow that motion pictures should be disqualified from First Amendment
protection. If there be capacity for evil it may be relevant in
determining the permissible scope of community control, but it does not
authorize substantially unbridled censorship such as we have here.

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that expression by means of motion pictures is included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. To the extent that language in the opinion in [*Mutual Film Corp.* v. *Industrial Comm'n, supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7270078849202844362&q=burstyn&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*,* is out of harmony with the views here set forth, we no longer adhere to it.

To hold that liberty of expression by means of motion pictures is
guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, however, is not the
end of our problem. It does not follow that the Constitution requires
absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all
times and all places. That much is evident from the series of decisions
of this Court with respect to other  media of communication of
ideas. Nor does it follow that motion pictures are
necessarily subject to the precise rules governing any other particular
method of expression. Each method tends to present its own peculiar
problems. But the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press,
like the First Amendment's command, do not vary. Those principles, as
they have frequently been enunciated by this Court, make freedom of
expression the rule. There is no justification in this case for making
an exception to that rule.

The statute involved here does not seek to punish, as a past offense,
speech or writing falling within the permissible scope of subsequent
punishment. On the contrary, New York requires that permission to
communicate ideas be obtained in advance from state officials who judge
the content of the words and pictures sought to be communicated. This
Court recognized many years ago that such a previous restraint is a form
of infringement upon freedom of expression to be especially condemned.
[*Near* v. *Minnesota ex rel. Olson,* 283 U.S. 697 (1931)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10240616562166401834&q=burstyn&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The Court there recounted the history which indicates that a major
purpose of the First Amendment guaranty of a free press was to prevent
prior restraints upon publication, although it was carefully pointed out
that the liberty of the press is not limited to that
protection. It was further stated that "the protection
even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited. But the
limitation has been recognized only  in exceptional cases."
*Id.,* at 716. In the light of the First Amendment's history and of the
*Near* decision, the State has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the
limitation challenged here presents such an exceptional case.

New York's highest court says there is "nothing mysterious" about the
statutory provision applied in this case: "It is simply this: that no
religion, as that word is understood by the ordinary, reasonable person,
shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn and ridicule. . .
." This is far from the kind of narrow exception to
freedom of expression which a state may carve out to satisfy the adverse
demands of other interests of society. In seeking to
apply the broad and all-inclusive definition of "sacrilegious" given by
the New York courts, the censor is set adrift upon a boundless sea amid
a myriad of conflicting currents of religious views, with no 
charts but those provided by the most vocal and powerful orthodoxies.
New York cannot vest such unlimited restraining control over motion
pictures in a censor. Cf. [*Kunz* v. *New York,* 340 U. S. 290
(1951)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9105752986676100521&q=burstyn&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

Under such a standard the most careful and tolerant censor would find it
virtually impossible to avoid favoring one religion over another, and he
would be subject to an inevitable tendency to ban the expression of
unpopular sentiments sacred to a religious minority. Application of the
"sacrilegious" test, in these or other respects, might raise substantial
questions under the First Amendment's guaranty of separate church and
state with freedom of worship for all. However, from the
standpoint of freedom of speech and the press, it is enough to point out
that the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all
religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify
prior restraints upon the expression of those views. It is not the
business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined
attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in
publications, speeches, or motion pictures.

Since the term "sacrilegious" is the sole standard under attack here, it
is not necessary for us to decide, for example,  whether a state
may censor motion pictures under a clearly drawn statute designed and
applied to prevent the showing of obscene films. That is a very
different question from the one now before us. We hold
only that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments a state may not ban
a film on the basis of a censor's conclusion that it is "sacrilegious."

*Reversed.*

### Categories of Unprotected Speech 

In declaring that movies are indeed protected speech under the First Amendment, the *Burstyn* Court took pains to point out that the film was not obscene within the meaning of another famous First Amendment case.

### *Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire*

###### U.S. Supreme Court (1942)
 
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=315+U.S.+568&appflag=67.12).
* [case at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplinsky_v._New_Hampshire).

In late 1941, Walter Chaplinsky, a Jehovah's Witness, was preaching on a public sidewalk in downtown Rochester, New Hampshire. It was a busy Saturday afternoon, and Chaplinsky was passing out pamphlets and railing against organized religion, calling it a "racket." People complained to City Marshal Bowering, who responded by saying that Chaplinsky was "lawfully engaged." But Marshal Bowering also warned Chaplinsky that the crowd was getting restless. 

Later, a disturbance occurred and the traffic officer on duty at the busy intersection started with Chaplinsky for the police station. On a public sidewalk near City Hall, the officer and Chaplinsky met Marshal Bowering who had been advised that a riot was under way and was therefore hurrying to the scene. Bowering repeated his earlier warning to Chaplinsky. Chaplinsky then shouted at Bowering:

> You are a Goddamned racketeer and a damned Fascist and the whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists.

Chaplinsky was arrested, charged and convicted in the municipal court of Rochester, New Hampshire, for violating a statute a New Hampshire state law that provided:

> No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any
other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, nor
call him by any offensive or derisive name, nor make any noise or
exclamation in his presence and hearing with intent to deride, offend or
annoy him, or to prevent him from pursuing his lawful business or
occupation.

Chaplinsky appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, claiming that the law was "vague" and that it infringed upon his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech.  

Justice Murphy, writing for a unanimous court, upheld Chaplinsky's conviction under the statute and crafted one of the most widely quoted paragraphs in First Amendment jurisprudence, often cited in cases where the first amendment speaker is about to lose the case:

> [T]he right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances. There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention  and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting" words--those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality. "Resort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act would raise no question under that instrument.

## Unprotected Speech

Some call this a "two-tier" or "category" approach to the First Amendment, meaning, some speech is protected by the First Amendment and some isn't. *Chaplinsky* is famous for listing the classes of speech historically not protected by the First Amendment, but also famous for planting the seed of the notion that not all speech is valuable or "essential" to the "exposition of ideas," a very Brandeis-like argument. 

Some of the categories (the obscene, the libelous, fighting words) are still with us. The Court has outlined several others (incitement, child pornography), but as we'll see the current Roberts Court is not receptive to legislatures adding "new" categories of unprotected speech, like [stolen valor speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Valor_Act_of_2013), or [animal crush videos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Stevens). 

Other governments have different concerns and different categories of offensive speech. France and Germany prohibit varieties of hate speech or speech denying the historical facts of the Holocaust. See, for example, the wide variety of free speech laws collected at Wikipedia: [Free Speech By Country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country). Canadian courts have held that pornography which is "degrading or dehumanizing" to women may be prohibited (see [R. v. Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._v._Butler) an analysis explicitly rejected by Judge Frank Easterbrook in [*American Booksellers v.  Hudnut*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=771+F.2d+323&appflag=67.12), 771 F2d 323 (7th Cir. 1985), *aff’d mem.*, 475 U.S. 1001 (1986), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Booksellers_v._Hudnut).

* [Nice summary of speech restrictions and unprotected speech categories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States#Types_of_speech_restrictions)

Child pornography and disclosing classified communications in violation of the Espionage Act are good examples. Both involve SPEECH, but the U.S. Supreme Court says these categories of speech are not protected by the First Amendment. Child porn and disclosing classified information therefore are both categories of "unprotected speech," meaning the  government can fine you or send you to prison for engaging in them. [18 U.S. Code &sect; 2251 - Sexual exploitation of children](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2251)

For several decades in the second half of the last century, the Supreme Court was deluged with obscentity cases, clearly a category of unprotected speech. But the problem was defining it.

Justice Potter Stewart gave the most honest and memorable definition in [*Jacobellis v. Ohio* (1964)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio):

> I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ["hard-core pornography"]; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. **But I know it when I see it**, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.

As we'll see later, obscenity trials are almost pass&eacute; because of the advent of the Internet, but obscenity is worth studying because it provides case studies in how legislatures attempt to ban certain categories of speech. If intellectual property is like oil, waiting to gush forth and become valuable, then it's as if the government says: It's against the law for you to drill for certain kinds of speech, or make certain kinds of intellectual property. 

No better example then 2 Live Crew's "Nasty As They Wanna Be."

## Child Pornography 

In [*New York v. Ferber*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Ferber), 58 U.S. 747 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the State of New York could ban the sale of material depicting children engaged in sexual activity. 

Child pornography, the court said, is unprotected speech, not because it is obscene but because actual children are harmed in the making of it, and the resulting product provides a permanent record of the harm done, capable of inflicting grievous damage on child actors long afterwards.

Which raised the question: What about virtual child pornography, in which no actual children are used as actors?

### *Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition*

###### U.S. Supreme Court (2002)

* [case at Westlaw][ashcroft].
* [case at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition)

Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.

#### Excerpts from the *Ashcroft* opinion:

We consider in this case whether the Child Pornography Prevention Act of
1996 (CPPA), 18 U. S. C. § 2251 *et seq.,* abridges the freedom of
speech. The CPPA extends the federal prohibition against child
pornography to sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors but
were produced without using any real children. The statute prohibits, in
specific circumstances, possessing or distributing these images, which
may be created by using adults who  look like minors or by using
computer imaging. The new technology, according to Congress, makes it
possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist. See
Congressional Findings, notes following 18 U. S. C. § 2251.

By prohibiting child pornography that does not depict an actual child,
the statute goes beyond [*New York* v. *Ferber,* 458 U. S. 747
(1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
which distinguished child pornography from other sexually explicit
speech because of the State's interest in protecting the children
exploited by the production process. See *id.,* at 758. As a general
rule, pornography can be banned only if obscene, but under *Ferber,*
pornography showing minors can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene under the definition set forth in [*Miller* v. *California,* 413 U. S. 15
(1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
*Ferber* recognized that "[t]he *Miller* standard, like all general
definitions of what may be banned as obscene, does not reflect the
State's particular and more compelling interest in prosecuting those who
promote the sexual exploitation of children." [458 U. S., at
761](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

While we have not had occasion to consider the question, we may assume
that the apparent age of persons engaged in sexual conduct is relevant
to whether a depiction offends community standards. Pictures of young
children engaged in certain acts might be obscene where similar
depictions of adults, or perhaps even older adolescents, would not. The
CPPA, however, is not directed at speech that is obscene; Congress has
proscribed those materials through a separate statute. 18 U. S. C. §§
1460-1466. Like the law in *Ferber,* the CPPA seeks to reach beyond
obscenity, and it makes no attempt to conform to the *Miller* standard.
For instance, the statute would reach visual depictions, such as movies,
even if they have redeeming social value.

The principal question to be resolved, then, is whether the CPPA is
constitutional where it proscribes a significant universe of speech that
is neither obscene under *Miller* nor child pornography under *Ferber.*

####  I

Before 1996, Congress defined child pornography as the type of
depictions at issue in *Ferber,* images made using actual minors.
The CPPA retains that prohibition at 18 U. S.
C. § 2256(8)(A) and adds three other prohibited categories of speech, of
which the first, § 2256(8)(B), and the third, § 2256(8)(D), are at issue
in this case. Section 2256(8)(B) prohibits:

> "any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or
computer-generated image or picture," that "is, or appears to be, of a
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 

The prohibition on "any
visual depiction" does not depend at all on how the image is produced.
The section captures a range of depictions, sometimes called "virtual
child pornography," which include computer-generated images, as well as
images produced by more traditional means. For instance, the literal
terms of the statute embrace a Renaissance painting depicting a scene
from classical mythology, a "picture" that "appears to be, of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct." The statute also prohibits
Hollywood movies, filmed without any child actors, if a jury believes an
actor "appears to be" a minor engaging in "actual or simulated . . .
sexual intercourse." 

These images do not involve, let alone harm, any children in the
production process; but Congress decided the materials threaten children
in other, less direct, ways. Pedophiles might use the materials to
encourage children to participate in sexual activity. "[A] child who is
reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to pose for
sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced by viewing
depictions of other children 'having fun' participating in such
activity." Congressional Finding (3), notes following § 2251.
Furthermore, pedophiles might "whet their own sexual appetites" with the
pornographic images, "thereby increasing the creation and distribution
of child pornography and the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual
children." *Id.,* Findings  (4), (10)(B). Under these
rationales, harm flows from the content of the images, not from the
means of their production. In addition, Congress identified another
problem created by computer-generated images: Their existence can make
it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors. See *id.,*
Finding (6)(A). As imaging technology improves, Congress found, it
becomes more difficult to prove that a particular picture was produced
using actual children. To ensure that defendants possessing child
pornography using real minors cannot evade prosecution, Congress
extended the ban to virtual child pornography.

Section 2256(8)(C) prohibits a more common and lower tech means of
creating virtual images, known as computer morphing. Rather than
creating original images, pornographers can alter innocent pictures of
real children so that the children appear to be engaged in sexual
activity. Although morphed images may fall within the definition of
virtual child pornography, they implicate the interests of real children
and are in that sense closer to the images in *Ferber.* Respondents do
not challenge this provision, and we do not consider it.

Respondents do challenge § 2256(8)(D). Like the text of the "appears to
be" provision, the sweep of this provision is quite broad. Section
2256(8)(D) defines child pornography to include any sexually explicit
image that was:

> "advertised, promoted, presented, described, or
distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression" it depicts "a
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 

One Committee Report
identified the provision as directed at sexually explicit images
pandered as child pornography. 
("This provision prevents child pornographers and pedophiles from
exploiting prurient interests in child sexuality and sexual activity
through the production or distribution of pornographic material which is
intentionally pandered as child pornography"). The statute is not so
limited in its reach, however, as it punishes even  those
possessors who took no part in pandering. Once a work has been described
as child pornography, the taint remains on the speech in the hands of
subsequent possessors, making possession unlawful even though the
content otherwise would not be objectionable.

Fearing that the CPPA threatened the activities of its members,
respondent Free Speech Coalition and others challenged the statute in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. The Coalition, a California trade association for the
adult-entertainment industry, alleged that its members did not use
minors in their sexually explicit works, but they believed some of these
materials might fall within the CPPA's expanded definition of child
pornography. The other respondents are Bold Type, Inc., the publisher of
a book advocating the nudist lifestyle; Jim Gingerich, a painter of
nudes; and Ron Raffaelli, a photographer specializing in erotic images.
Respondents alleged that the "appears to be" and "conveys the
impression" provisions are overbroad and vague, chilling them from
producing works protected by the First Amendment. The District Court
disagreed and granted summary judgment to the Government. The court
dismissed the overbreadth claim because it was "highly unlikely" that
any "adaptations of sexual works like \`Romeo and Juliet,' . . . will be
treated as \`criminal contraband.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a—63a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. See [198 F. 3d 1083
(1999)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The court reasoned that the Government could not prohibit speech because
of its tendency to persuade viewers to commit illegal acts. The court
held the CPPA to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials
that are neither obscene nor produced by the exploitation of real
children as in [*New York* v. *Ferber,* 458 U. S. 747
(1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Judge Ferguson dissented on the ground that virtual images, like
obscenity and real child pornography, should be treated as a category of
speech unprotected by the First Amendment. [198 F. 3d, at
1097](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The Court of Appeals voted to  deny the petition for rehearing
en banc, over the dissent of three judges. See 220 F. 3d 1113 (2000).

While the Ninth Circuit found the CPPA invalid on its face, four other

We granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1124 (2001).

#### II

The First Amendment commands, "Congress shall make no law . . .
abridging the freedom of speech." The government may violate this
mandate in many ways, *e. g.,* [*Rosenberger* v. *Rector and Visitors of
Univ. of Va.,* 515 U. S. 819
(1995)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5541076601148584638&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
[*Keller* v. *State Bar of Cal.,* 496 U. S. 1
(1990),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15416438635105441831&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
but a law imposing criminal penalties on protected speech is a stark
example of speech suppression. The CPPA's penalties are indeed severe. A
first offender may be imprisoned for 15 years. § 2252A(b)(1). A repeat
offender faces a prison sentence of not less than 5 years and not more
than 30 years in prison. *Ibid.* While even minor punishments can chill
protected speech, see [*Wooley* v. *Maynard,* 430 U. S. 705
(1977),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15210508422263730617&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
this case provides a textbook example of why we permit facial challenges
to statutes that burden expression. With these severe penalties in
force, few legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other
speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the
uncertain reach of this law. The Constitution gives significant
protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First
Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, the CPPA
is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of
protected expression. See [*Broadrick* v. *Oklahoma,* 413 U. S. 601, 612
(1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant
to the moral instincts of a decent people. In  its legislative
findings, Congress recognized that there are subcultures of persons who
harbor illicit desires for children and commit criminal acts to gratify
the impulses. See Congressional Findings, notes following § 2251; see
also U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Administration on
Children, Youth and Families, Child Maltreatment 1999 (estimating that
93,000 children were victims of sexual abuse in 1999). Congress also
found that surrounding the serious offenders are those who flirt with
these impulses and trade pictures and written accounts of sexual
activity with young children.

Congress may pass valid laws to protect children from abuse, and it has.
The prospect of crime, however, by
itself does not justify laws suppressing protected speech. See
[*Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.* v. *Regents of Univ. of N. Y.,* 360 U.
S. 684, 689
(1959)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3228427129910896091&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent
crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not
abridgment of the rights of free speech" (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)). It is also well established that speech may not be
prohibited because it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities. See
[*FCC* v. *Pacifica Foundation,* 438 U. S. 726, 745
(1978)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9738309099999149495&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("[T]he fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient
reason for suppressing it"); see also [*Reno* v. *American Civil
Liberties Union,* 521 U. S. 844, 874
(1997)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1557224836887427725&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("In evaluating the free speech rights of adults, we have made it
perfectly clear that \`[s]exual expression which is indecent but not
obscene is protected by the First Amendment' ") (quoting [*Sable

(1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959937071120946576&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0));

("[T]he fact that protected speech may be offensive to some does not
justify its suppression").

As a general principle, the First Amendment bars the government from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear. The freedom of speech has its limits; it does not  embrace certain categories of speech, including defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real children. See [*Simon & Schuster, Inc.* v. *Members of N. Y.* *State Crime Victims Bd.,* 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=988401867966498877&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  While these categories may be prohibited without violating the First Amendment, none of them includes the speech prohibited by the CPPA. In his dissent from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, Judge Ferguson recognized this to be the law and proposed that virtual child pornography should be regarded as an additional category of unprotected speech. See [198 F. 3d, at 1101](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  It would be necessary for us to take this step to uphold the statute.

As we have noted, the CPPA is much more than a supplement to the existing federal prohibition on obscenity. Under [*Miller* v. *California,* 413 U. S. 15 (1973),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) the Government must prove that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. *Id.,* at 24. The CPPA, however, extends to images that appear to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity without regard to the *Miller* requirements. The materials need not appeal to the prurient interest. Any depiction of sexually explicit activity, no matter how it is presented, is proscribed. The CPPA applies to a picture in a psychology manual, as well as a movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse. It is not necessary, moreover, that the image be patently offensive. Pictures of what appear to be 17-year-olds engaging in sexually explicit activity do not in every case contravene community standards.

The CPPA prohibits speech despite its serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value. The statute proscribes the visual
depiction of an idea—that of teenagers engaging in sexual activity—that
is a fact of modern society and has been a theme in art and literature
throughout the ages.  Under the CPPA, images are prohibited so
long as the persons appear to be under 18 years of age.
This is higher than the legal age for marriage in many States,
as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations . . . . 
(48 States permit 16-year-olds to marry with parental consent) . . . . 
(in 39 States and the District of Columbia, the age
of consent is 16 or younger). It is, of course,
undeniable that some youths in sexual activity before the legal age,
either on their own inclination or because they are victims of sexual
abuse.

Both themes--teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of
children--have inspired countless literary works. William Shakespeare
created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13
years of age. See Romeo and Juliet, act I, sc. 2, l. 9 ("She hath not
seen the change of fourteen years"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays
the relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not juvenile.
The work has inspired no less than 40 motion pictures, some of which
suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship. *E.g.,*
Romeo and Juliet (B. Luhrmann director, 1996). Shakespeare may not have
written sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but were
modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach, that fact alone
would not compel the conclusion that the work was obscene.

Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's Academy Awards
featured the movie, Traffic, which was nominated for Best Picture. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16year-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her  to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before, American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the course of the movie, a
teenage girl engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, and
another yields herself to the gratification of a middle-aged man. The
film also contains a scene where, although the movie audience
understands the act is not taking place, one character believes he is
watching a teenage boy performing a sexual act on an older man.

Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring fascination
with the lives and destinies of the young. Art and literature express
the vital interest we all have in the formative years we ourselves once
knew, when wounds can be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and
mistaken choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self-fulfillment are
still in reach. Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA,
they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions.
If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those
subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within
the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to
severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value. This
is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic
merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit
scene. See [*Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"*
v. *Attorney General of Mass.,* 383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966) (plurality
opinion)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10189557359995044131&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("[T]he social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor
canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness"). Under
*Miller,* the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by
considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the
narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even
though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See [*Kois* v.
*Wisconsin,* 408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972)
*(per*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14245554701828404349&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)[*curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14245554701828404349&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
For this reason, and the others we have noted, the CPPA cannot be read
to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its
prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the
definition of obscenity.

The Government seeks to address this deficiency by arguing that speech
prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from child
pornography, which may be banned without regard to whether it depicts
works of value. See [*New York* v. *Ferber,* 458 U. S., at
761](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Where the images are themselves the product of child sexual abuse,
*Ferber* recognized that the State had an interest in stamping it out
without regard to any judgment about its content. See also *id.,* at 775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("As drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication of
particular ideas"). The production of the work, not its content, was the
target of the statute. The fact that a work contained serious literary,
artistic, or other value did not excuse the harm it caused to its child
participants. It was simply "unrealistic to equate a community's
toleration for sexually oriented materials with the permissible scope of
legislation aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation."

*Ferber* upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale of child
pornography, as well as its production, because these acts were
"intrinsically related" to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. First, as a permanent record of a child's abuse, the
continued circulation itself would harm the child who had participated.
Like a defamatory statement, each new publication of the speech would
cause new injury to the child's reputation and emotional well-being. Second, because the traffic in child
pornography was an economic motive for its production, the State had an
interest in closing the distribution network. "The most expeditious if
not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the
market for this material  by imposing severe criminal penalties
on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product." Under either rationale, the speech had what the Court in
effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came.

Later, in [*Osborne* v. *Ohio,* 495 U. S. 103
(1990),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the Court ruled that these same interests justified a ban on the
possession of pornography produced by using children. "Given the
importance of the State's interest in protecting the victims of child
pornography," the State was justified in "attempting to stamp out this
vice at all levels in the distribution chain." *Id.,* at 110. *Osborne*
also noted the State's interest in preventing child pornography from
being used as an aid in the solicitation of minors. *Id.,* at 111. The
Court, however, anchored its holding in the concern for the
participants, those whom it called the "victims of child pornography."
*Id.,* at 110. It did not suggest that, absent this concern, other
governmental interests would suffice. See *infra,* at 251-253.

In contrast to the speech in *Ferber,* speech that itself is the record
of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and
creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not
"intrinsically related" to the sexual abuse of children, as were the materials in *Ferber.* [458 U. S., at 759](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  While the Government asserts that the images can lead to actual instances of child abuse, see *infra,* at 251-254, the causal link is contingent and indirect. The harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts.

The Government says these indirect harms are sufficient because, as
*Ferber* acknowledged, child pornography rarely can be valuable speech.
See [458 U. S., at
762](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("The value of permitting live performances and photographic
reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly
modest, if not *de minimis* "). This argument, however, suffers from two
flaws. First, *Ferber* \`s judgment  about child pornography was
based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated. The case
reaffirmed that where the speech is neither obscene nor the product of
sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the protection of the First
Amendment. See *id.,* at 764-765 ("[T]he distribution of descriptions or
other depictions of sexual conduct, not otherwise obscene, which do not
involve live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of
live performances, retains First Amendment protection").

The second flaw in the Government's position is that *Ferber* did not
hold that child pornography is by definition without value. On the
contrary, the Court recognized some works in this category might have
significant value, see *id.,* at 761, but relied on virtual images—the
very images prohibited by the CPPA—as an alternative and permissible
means of expression: "[I]f it were necessary for literary or artistic
value, a person over the statutory age who perhaps looked younger could
be utilized. Simulation outside of the prohibition of the statute could
provide another alternative." *Id.,* at 763. *Ferber,* then, not only
referred to the distinction between actual and virtual child
pornography, it relied on it as a reason supporting its holding.
*Ferber* provides no support for a statute that eliminates the
distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as well.

#### III

The CPPA, for reasons we have explored, is inconsistent with *Miller*
and finds no support in *Ferber.* The Government seeks to justify its
prohibitions in other ways. It argues that the CPPA is necessary because
pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children. There
are many things innocent in themselves, however, such as cartoons, video
games, and candy, that might be used for immoral purposes, yet we would
not expect those to be prohibited because they can be misused. The
Government, of course, may punish adults who provide unsuitable
materials  to children, see [*Ginsberg* v. *New York,* 390 U. S.
629
(1968),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
and it may enforce criminal penalties for unlawful solicitation. The
precedents establish, however, that speech within the rights of adults
to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children
from it. See [*Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.* v. *FCC,* 492 U. S.
115
(1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959937071120946576&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

the Court invalidated a statute prohibiting distribution of an indecent
publication because of its tendency to "\`incite minors to violent or
depraved or immoral acts.' " A unanimous Court agreed upon the important
First Amendment principle that the State could not "reduce the adult
population . . . to reading only what is fit for children." *Id.,* at
383. We have reaffirmed this holding. See [*United States* v. *Playboy

at
130-131](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959937071120946576&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(striking down a ban on "dial-a-porn" messages that had "the invalid
effect of limiting the content of adult telephone conversations to that
which is suitable for children to hear").

Here, the Government wants to keep speech from children not to protect
them from its content but to protect them from those who would commit
other crimes. The principle, however, remains the same: The Government
cannot ban speech fit for adults simply because it may fall into the
hands of children. The evil in question depends upon the actor's
unlawful conduct, conduct defined as criminal quite apart from any link
to the speech in question. This establishes that the speech ban is not
narrowly drawn. The objective is to prohibit illegal conduct, but this
restriction goes well  beyond that interest by restricting the
speech available to law-abiding adults.

The Government submits further that virtual child pornography whets the
appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal
conduct. This rationale cannot sustain the provision in question. The
mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient
reason for banning it. The government "cannot constitutionally premise
legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's private
thoughts." [*Stanley* v. *Georgia,* 394 U. S. 557, 566
(1969)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6728320798248524934&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to
control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end. The
right to think is the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected
from the government because speech is the beginning of thought.

To preserve these freedoms, and to protect speech for its own sake, the
Court's First Amendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and
deeds, between ideas and conduct. See [*Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.,*
360 U. S., at
689](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3228427129910896091&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
see also [*Bartnicki* v. *Vopper,* 532 U. S. 514, 529
(2001)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2171346211086974391&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an
appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it"). The government
may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act
will be committed "at some indefinite future time." [*Hess* v.
*Indiana,* 414 U. S. 105, 108 (1973) *(per
curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4042159652386241321&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
The government may suppress speech for advocating the use of force or a
violation of law only if "such advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action." [*Brandenburg* v. *Ohio,* 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969) *(per
curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
There is here no attempt, incitement, solicitation, or conspiracy. The
Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech
that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse.
Without a significantly stronger, more direct connection, the Government
may not prohibit  speech on the ground that it may encourage
pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.

The Government next argues that its objective of eliminating the market
for pornography produced using real children necessitates a prohibition
on virtual images as well. Virtual images, the Government contends, are
indistinguishable from real ones; they are part of the same market and
are often exchanged. In this way, it is said, virtual images promote the
trafficking in works produced through the exploitation of real children.
The hypothesis is somewhat implausible. If virtual images were identical
to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from
the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would
risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized
images would suffice.

In the case of the material covered by *Ferber,* the creation of the
speech is itself the crime of child abuse; the prohibition deters the
crime by removing the profit motive. See [*Osborne,* 495 U. S., at
109-110](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Even where there is an underlying crime, however, the Court has not
allowed the suppression of speech in all cases. *E. g.,* [*Bartnicki,
supra,* at
529](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2171346211086974391&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(market deterrence would not justify law prohibiting a radio commentator
from distributing speech that had been unlawfully intercepted). We need
not consider where to strike the balance in this case, because here,
there is no underlying crime at all. Even if the Government's market
deterrence theory were persuasive in some contexts, it would not justify
this statute.

Finally, the Government says that the possibility of producing images by
using computer imaging makes it very difficult for it to prosecute those
who produce pornography by using real children. Experts, we are told,
may have difficulty in saying whether the pictures were made by using
real children or by using computer imaging. The necessary solution, the
argument runs, is to prohibit both kinds of images.  The
argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means
to ban unprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment
upside down.

The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress
unlawful speech. Protected speech does not become unprotected merely
because it resembles the latter. The Constitution requires the reverse.
"[T]he possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to
go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of
others may be muted . . . ." [*Broadrick* v. *Oklahoma,* 413 U. S., at
612](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The overbreadth doctrine prohibits the Government from banning
unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is
prohibited or chilled in the process.

To avoid the force of this objection, the Government would have us read
the CPPA not as a measure suppressing speech but as a law shifting the
burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful. In this connection,
the Government relies on an affirmative defense under the statute, which
allows a defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by
showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not
otherwise distributed in a manner conveying the impression that they
depicted real children. See 18 U. S. C. § 2252A(c).

The Government raises serious constitutional difficulties by seeking to
impose on the defendant the burden of proving his speech is not
unlawful. An affirmative defense applies only after prosecution has
begun, and the speaker must himself prove, on pain of a felony
conviction, that his conduct falls within the affirmative defense. In
cases under the CPPA, the evidentiary burden is not trivial. Where the
defendant is not the producer of the work, he may have no way of
establishing the identity, or even the existence, of the actors. If the
evidentiary issue is a serious problem for the Government, as it
asserts, it will be at least as difficult  for the innocent
possessor. The statute, moreover, applies to work created before 1996,
and the producers themselves may not have preserved the records
necessary to meet the burden of proof. Failure to establish the defense
can lead to a felony conviction.

We need not decide, however, whether the Government could impose this
burden on a speaker. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute
from First Amendment challenge, here the defense is incomplete and
insufficient, even on its own terms. It allows persons to be convicted
in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in
the production. A defendant charged with possessing, as opposed to
distributing, proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the
film depicts only adult actors. See *ibid.* So while the affirmative
defense may protect a movie producer from prosecution for the act of
distribution, that same producer, and all other persons in the
subsequent distribution chain, could be liable for possessing the
prohibited work. Furthermore, the affirmative defense provides no
protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging, or
through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who
appear to be minors. See *ibid.* In these cases, the defendant can
demonstrate no children were harmed in producing the images, yet the
affirmative defense would not bar the prosecution. For this reason, the
affirmative defense cannot save the statute, for it leaves unprotected a
substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government's interest in
distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones.

In sum, § 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized
in *Ferber* and *Miller,* and the reasons the Government offers in
support of limiting the freedom of speech have no justification in our
precedents or in the law of the First Amendment. The provision abridges
the freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech. For this
reason, it is overbroad and unconstitutional . . . .

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

In my view, the Government's most persuasive asserted interest in support of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) is the prosecution rationale--that persons who possess and disseminate pornographic images of real children may escape conviction by claiming that the images are computer generated, thereby raising a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. At this time, however, the Government asserts only that defendants *raise* such defenses, not that they have done so successfully. In fact, the Government points to no case in which a defendant has been acquitted based on a "computer-generated images" defense. While this speculative interest cannot support the broad reach of the CPPA, technology may evolve to the point where it becomes impossible to enforce actual child pornography laws because the Government cannot prove that certain pornographic images are of real children. In the event this occurs, the Government should not be foreclosed from enacting a regulation of virtual child pornography that contains an appropriate affirmative defense or some other narrowly drawn restriction.

The Court suggests that the Government's interest in enforcing prohibitions against real child pornography cannot justify prohibitions on virtual child pornography, because "[t]his analysis turns the First Amendment upside down. The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech." But if technological advances thwart prosecution of "unlawful speech," the Government may well have a compelling interest in barring or otherwise regulating some narrow category of "lawful speech" in order to enforce effectively laws against pornography made through the abuse of real children. The Court does leave open the possibility that a more complete affirmative defense could save a statute's constitutionality, implicitly accepting that some  regulation of virtual child pornography might be constitutional. I would not prejudge, however, whether a more complete affirmative defense is the only way to narrowly tailor a criminal statute that prohibits the possession and dissemination of virtual child pornography. Thus, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

[Justice O'Connor's dissent omitted]

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia joins in part,
dissenting.

We normally do not strike down a statute on First Amendment grounds
"when a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the
challenged statute." [*Parker* v. *Levy,* 417 U. S. 733, 760
(1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7171415278006906954&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("This Court has .. . repeatedly expressed its reluctance to strike down
a statute on its face where there were a substantial number of
situations to which it might be validly applied"). This case should be
treated no differently.

Other than computer-generated images that are virtually
indistinguishable from real children engaged in sexually explicit
conduct, the CPPA can be limited so as not to reach any material that
was not already unprotected before the CPPA. The CPPA's definition of
"sexually explicit conduct" is quite explicit in this regard. It makes
clear that the statute only reaches "visual depictions" of:

> "[A]ctual or simulated . . . sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; . . . bestiality; . . . masturbation; . . . sadistic or masochistic abuse; or . . . lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person." 18 U. S. C. § 2256(2).

 The Court and Justice O'Connor suggest that this very graphic
definition reaches the depiction of youthful looking adult actors
engaged in suggestive sexual activity, presumably because the definition
extends to "simulated" intercourse. *Ante,* at 247-248 (majority
opinion); *ante,* at 263 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). Read as a whole, however, I think the definition
reaches only the sort of "hard core of child pornography" that we found
without protection in [*Ferber, supra,* at 773—
774](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
So construed, the CPPA bans visual depictions of youthful looking adult
actors engaged in *actual* sexual activity; mere *suggestions* of sexual
activity, such as youthful looking adult actors squirming under a
blanket, are more akin to written descriptions than visual depictions,
and thus fall outside the purview of the statute . . . .

Indeed, we should be loath to construe a statute as banning film
portrayals of Shakespearian tragedies, without some indication—from text
or legislative history—that such a result was intended. In fact,
Congress explicitly instructed that such a reading of the CPPA would be
wholly unwarranted. As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has
observed:

> "[T]he legislative record, which makes plain that the [CPPA] was
> intended to target only a narrow class of images—visual depictions
> \`which are virtually indistinguishable to unsuspecting viewers from
> unretouched photographs of actual children engaging in identical
> sexual conduct.' " [*United States* v. *Hilton,* 167 F. 3d 61, 72
> (1999)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14561000702379646006&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
> (quoting S. Rep. No. 104-358, pt. I, p. 7 (1996)).

This narrow reading of "sexually explicit conduct" not only accords with
the text of the CPPA and the intentions of Congress; it is exactly how
the phrase was understood prior to the broadening gloss the Court gives
it today. Indeed, had "sexually explicit conduct" been thought to reach
the sort of material the Court says it does, then films such as Traffic
and American Beauty would not have been made the way they were. *Ante,*
at 247-248 (discussing these films' portrayals of youthful looking adult
actors engaged in sexually suggestive conduct). Traffic won its Academy
Award in 2001. American Beauty won its Academy Award in 2000. But the
CPPA has been on the books, and has been enforced, since 1996. The chill
felt by the Court, *ante,* at 244 ("[F]ew legitimate movie producers . .
. would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this
law"), has apparently never been felt by those who actually make movies.

To the extent the CPPA prohibits possession or distribution of materials
that "convey the impression" of a child engaged in sexually explicit
conduct, that prohibition can and should be limited to reach "the sordid
business of pandering" which lies outside the bounds of First Amendment
protection. [*Ginzburg* v. *United States,* 383 U. S. 463, 467
(1966)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
*e. g., id.,* at 472 (conduct that "deliberately emphasized the sexually
provocative aspects of the work, in order to catch the salaciously
disposed," may lose First Amendment protection); [*United States* v.
*Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,* 529 U. S. 803, 831-832 (2000)
(Scalia, J.,
dissenting)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(collecting cases). This is how the Government asks us to construe the
statute, Brief for Petitioners 18, and n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and it
is the most plausible reading of the text, which prohibits only
materials "*advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed
in such a manner* that conveys the  impression that the material
is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually
explicit conduct." 18 U. S. C. § 2256(8)(D) (emphasis added).

The First Amendment may protect the video shopowner or film distributor who promotes material as "entertaining" or "acclaimed" regardless of whether the material contains depictions of youthful looking adult actors engaged in nonobscene but sexually suggestive conduct. The First Amendment does not, however, protect the panderer. Thus, materials promoted as conveying the impression that they depict actual minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct do not escape regulation merely because they might warrant First Amendment protection if promoted in a different manner. See [*Ginzburg, supra,* at 474-476](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0); cf. [*Jacobellis* v. *Ohio,* 378 U. S. 184, 201 (1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15356452945994377133&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) ("In my opinion, the use to which various materials are put—not just the words and pictures themselves—must be considered in determining whether or not the materials are obscene"). I would construe "conveys the impression" as limited to the panderer, which makes the statute entirely consistent with *Ginzburg* and other cases.

In sum, while potentially impermissible applications of the CPPA may
exist, I doubt that they would be "substantial. . . inrelation to the
statute's plainly legitimate sweep." [*Broadrick,* 413 U. S., at
615](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  The aim of ensuring the enforceability of our Nation's child pornography laws is a compelling one. The CPPA is targeted to this aim by extending
the definition of child pornography to reach computergenerated images
that are virtually indistinguishable from real children engaged in
sexually explicit conduct. The statute need not be read to do any more
than precisely this, which is not offensive to the First Amendment.

For these reasons, I would construe the CPPA in a manner consistent with
the First Amendment, reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment, and uphold
the statute in its entirety.

## Indecency

Just as we get comfortable with the notion of categories, and the notion that speech is either protected or unprotected, along comes a category of speech the FCC wishes to REGULATE. 

Please read these two cases in their entirety. Keep your eye on the ball: Is George Carlin's speech protected speech? When Bono says, "This is really really fucking brilliant" during a prime time TV broadcast at the 2003 Golden Globe awards, is that obscene?

BONEYARD SCRAPS

The easiest way to see them in action is to look at some cases where the government has sued artists and tried to stop them from "speaking." In keeping with our intellectual property/oil well analogy, it's as if the government says: It's against the law for you to drill for certain kinds of speech, or make certain kinds of intellectual property. 

Most artists hope to earn their living in the intellectual property business, so their lawyers must know the rules. Here is a [handy list of unprotected speech categories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions).

The *Pacifica* footnotes on "excretions" are laughable these days when every other high-def ad on that huge TV screen is selling excretion-related product: Menstruation, incontence, BPH and frequency of urination, "regularity," and of course erectile dysfunction. 

The word "excretory" occurs nine times in the *Pacifica* opinion, and each it's the FCC that appears obsessed. In each citation of FCC materials, the Commission is careful to note that it's descriptions of "sexual *and* excretory functions" that are problematic. Not since [Stanley Kubrick's *Dr. Strangelove,*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove) where United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper was obsessed with the safety of "our nation's precious bodily fluids" have government officials put their own peculiar obsessions on display with such OCD flair. The FCC seems find the words "shit" and "piss" to be particularly disturbing and at various times has taken the position that "fuck" ALWAYS connotes sex, even if it's used by a rapper saying, "Fuck the police!" Justice Harlan and a wiser Court disposed of these matters once and for all in *Cohen v. California* back in 1972

In the latter half of the last century, the United States Supreme Court wrestled with obscenity statutes and definitions. 
  . But the obscenity problem has been largely "solved" by the Internet. These days those who want obscenity can easily find it online, and only once in a great while do others accidentally happen upon porn on the Internet. The porn industry is huge. Its paradox from day one. It needs to be everywhere and easily accessible, but also invisible, so as not to antagonize religious conservatives or market is huge, but the industry also depends for its survival 

the rest of the citizens of the Internet ever society d we know when we see it. Those who want to find it can easily do so, and the rest almost never accidentally see the stuff, so nobody cares. Hysterical If you want it, you can find it. On broadcast television here in 2014 it is a crime to say certain words. No major changes since *Pacifica*, just turf battles about how many times you can say fuck, or whether the person saying fuck is in a Steven Spielberg movie, where it's probably okay to say fuck, whereas if you were 
 Its content is regulated by the FCC if it is on broadcast television
Can it also be outlawed if it is just too violent?
