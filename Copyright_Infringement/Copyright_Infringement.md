## Infringement & Fair Use

###### Copying, Substantial Similarity, Parody

### Infringement

Copyright is violated only if the prior, copyrighted work has actually been *copied.* 

If I write an original song, 
then you come along, *copy* it, 
and publish it under your name, 
that's a copyright violation. 

If I write an original song, 
and you just happen to INDEPENDENTLY create an identical song, 
even though you have never heard my song or read my music, 
I have no recourse against you under the copyright laws. 

Judge Learned Hand put it this way:

> If by some magic a man who had never known it 
> were to compose anew Keats's *Ode on a Grecian Urn*, 
> he would be an 'author,' 
> and if he copyrights it, 
> others might not copy that poem, 
> though they might of course copy Keats's . . .

To prove copyright infringement, the copyright holder must establish:

1. Ownership of a valid copyright.
2. Copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.

[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co.](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1195336269698056315) (S.Ct. 1991)

#### Access & Substantial Similarity

Direct evidence of copying is rare, 
so courts rely instead on circumstantial evidence to prove copying, 
usually by allowing the plaintiff to prove 
that the works are substantially similar 
and that the defendant had **access** to the work.

Access is usually a crucial component of any copyright claim, 
because similarity alone is usually not enough. 
Creating a substantially similar work 
is not a copyright violation 
unless the defendant COPIED plaintiff's work.

> Plaintiff has the burden of proving 
> that the defendant copied original elements 
> from the plaintiff’s copyrighted work. 
> The plaintiff may show the defendant copied from the work 
> by showing by a preponderance of the evidence 
> that the **defendant had access** to the plaintiff’s copyrighted work 
> and that there are substantial similarities 
> between the defendant’s work 
> and original elements of the plaintiff’s work.

[U.S. Courts for the Ninth Circuit Manual of Model Civil Jury Instructions: 17.15 Copying—Access and Substantial Similarity](http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/272).

#### Striking Similarity

If the plaintiff is unable to prove 
that the defendant had access to plaintiff's work, 
then sometimes the court may allow plaintiff 
to prove that the two works are so **strikingly similar** 
that defendant must have had access. 
However courts are careful to point out that proof of striking similarity is 

> just one piece of circumstantial evidence 
> tending to show access 
> and must not be considered in isolation; 
> it must be considered together 
> with other types of circumstantial relating to access.

### *Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd.*

###### US Southern District New York (1976)

* [Case on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7721050309378220492)
* [Case on Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=420fsupp177&appflag=67.12) 
* [Case on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sweet_Lord#Copyright_infringement_suit).

One of the most famous copyright infringement suits of all time. 

First listen to ["He's So Fine,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU5qP20iJl0&feature=kp) a hit song composed by Ronnie Mack and performed by The Chiffons in the sixties.

Then listen to George Harrison's massive soulful hit ["My Sweet Lord"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kNGnIKUdMI&feature=kp).

Now see if you can tell why the Chiffons sued? 
Five years of litigation ensued, 
resulting in a verdict for Mack and against Harrison. 
The case stands for the unsettling proposition 
that copyright infringement need not be intentional, 
and indeed may even be "unconscious" 
or take place in the "subconscious." 
Metaphysics meets copyright. 
When your client wrote her song, 
did she unintentionally infringe on a lullaby her mother sang to her?

#### Excerpts from *Bright Tunes* opinion

OWEN, District Judge.

This is an action in which it is claimed that a successful song, 
"My Sweet Lord," listing George Harrison as the composer, 
is plagiarized from an earlier successful song, "He's So Fine," 
composed by Ronald Mack,
recorded by a singing group called the "Chiffons," 
the copyright of which is owned by plaintiff, Bright Tunes Music Corp.

'He's So Fine,' recorded in 1962, is a catchy tune 
consisting essentially of four repetitions of a very short basic musical phrase, 
"sol-mi-re," (hereinafter motif A), 
altered as necessary to fit the words, 
followed by four repetitions of another short basic musical phrase, 
"sol-la-do-la-do," (hereinafter motif B). 
While neither motif is novel, 
the four repetitions of A, 
followed by four repetitions of B, 
is a highly unique pattern. 
In addition,
in the second use of the motif B series, 
there is a grace note inserted
making the phrase go "sol-la-do-la-*re*-do."

"My Sweet Lord," recorded first in 1970, 
also uses the same motif A (modified to suit the words) four times, 
followed by motif B, repeated three times, not four. 
In place of "He's So Fine's" fourth repetition of motif B, 
"My Sweet Lord" has a transitional passage 
of musical attractiveness of the same approximate length, 
with the identical grace note in the identical second repetition. 
The harmonies of both songs are identical.

> Fn. 6. Expert witnesses for the defendants 
> asserted crucial differences in the two songs. 
> These claimed differences essentially stem, however, 
> from the fact that different words and number of syllables were involved. 
> This necessitated modest alterations in the repetitions 
> or the places of beginning of a phrase, which, 
> however, has nothing to do whatsoever 
> with the essential musical kernel that is involved.

George Harrison, a former member of The Beatles, 
was aware of "He's So Fine." 
In the United States, it was No. 1 on the billboard charts for five weeks; 
in England, Harrison's home country, 
it was No. 12 on the charts on June 1, 1963, 
a date upon which one of the Beatle songs was, in fact, in first position. 
For seven weeks in 1963, "He's So Fine"
was one of the top hits in England.

According to Harrison, 
the circumstances of the composition of My "Sweet Lord" were as follows. 
Harrison and his group, 
which include an American black gospel singer named Billy Preston, 
were in Copenhagen, Denmark, on a singing engagement. 
There was a press conference involving the group going on backstage. 
Harrison slipped away from the press conference 
and went to a room upstairs and began "vamping" some guitar chords, 
fitting on to the chords he was playing the words, 
"Hallelujah" and "Hare Krishna" in various ways.
During the course of this vamping, he was alternating between what
musicians call a Minor II chord and a Major V chord.

At some point &hellip; he went down to meet with others
of the group, asking them to listen, which they did, and everyone began
to join in, taking first "Hallelujah" and then "Hare Krishna" and
putting them into four part harmony. Harrison obviously started using
the "Hallelujah," etc., as repeated sounds, and from there developed the
lyrics, to wit, "My Sweet Lord," "Dear, Dear Lord," etc. In any event,
from this very free-flowing exchange of ideas, with Harrison playing his
two chords and everybody singing "Hallelujah" and "Hare Krishna," there
began to emerge the My Sweet Lord text idea, which Harrison sought to
develop a little bit further during the following week as he was playing
it on his guitar. Thus developed motif A and its words interspersed with
"Hallelujah" and "Hare Krishna."

> Fn. 8. These words ended up being a "responsive" interjection 
> between the eventually copyrighted words of "My Sweet Lord." 
> In "He's So Fine", the Chiffons used the sound "dulang" 
> in the same places to fill in and give rhythmic impetus 
> to what would otherwise be somewhat dead spots in the music.

Approximately one week after the idea first began to germinate, the
entire group flew back to London because they had earlier booked time to
go to a recording studio with Billy Preston to make an album. In the
studio, Preston was the principal musician. Harrison did not play in the
session. He had given Preston his basic motif A with the idea that it be
turned into a song, and was back and forth from the studio to the
engineer's recording booth, supervising the recording "takes." Under
circumstances that Harrison was utterly unable to recall, while
everybody was working toward a finished song, in the recording studio,
somehow or other the essential three notes of motif A reached polished
form.

> "Q. [By the Court]: . . . you feel that those three notes . . . the
> motif A in the record, those three notes developed somewhere in that
> recording session?

> "Mr. Harrison: I'd say those three there were finalized as beginning
> there."

> \* \* \* \* \* \*

> "Q. [By the Court]: Is it possible that Billy Preston hit on those
> [notes comprising motif A]?

> "Mr. Harrison: Yes, but it's possible also that I hit on that, too, as
> far back as the dressing room, just scat singing."

Similarly, it appears that motif B emerged in some fashion at the
recording session as did motif A. This is also true of the unique grace
note in the second repetition of motif B.

\* \* \*

The Billy Preston recording, listing George Harrison as the composer,
was thereafter issued by Apple Records. The music was then reduced to
paper by someone who prepared a "lead sheet" containing the melody, the
words and the harmony for the United States copyright
application.

Seeking the wellsprings of musical composition---why a composer chooses
the succession of notes and the harmonies he does---whether it be George
Harrison or Richard Wagner---is a fascinating inquiry. It is apparent from
the extensive colloquy between the Court and Harrison covering forty
pages in the transcript that neither Harrison nor Preston were conscious
of the fact that they were utilizing the He's So Fine
theme. However, they in fact were, for it is perfectly
obvious to the listener that in musical terms, the two songs are
virtually identical except for one phrase &hellip; [The judge then noted that "even Harrison's own expert witness acknowledged that although the two motifs were in the public domain, their use here was so unusual as to make them unique.]

What happened? I conclude that the composer, 
in seeking musical materials to clothe his thoughts, 
was working with various possibilities. 
As he tried this possibility and that, 
there came to the surface of his mind a particular combination that pleased him 
as being one he felt would be appealing to a prospective listener; 
in other words, that this combination of sounds would work. 
Why? Because his subconscious knew 
it already had worked in a song 
his conscious mind did not remember. 
Having arrived at this pleasing combination of sounds, 
the recording was made, 
the lead sheet prepared for copyright 
and the song became an enormous success. 
Did Harrison deliberately use the music of "He's So Fine?" 
I do not believe he did so deliberately. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that "My Sweet Lord" 
is the very same song as "He's So Fine" with different words, 
and Harrison had access to "He's So Fine." 
This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, 
and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.

Given the foregoing, I find for the plaintiff on the issue of
plagiarism, and set the action down for trial on November 8, 1976 on the
issue of damages and other relief as to which the plaintiff may be
entitled. The foregoing constitutes the Court's findings of fact and
conclusions of law.

So Ordered.

* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selle_v._Gibb).

CUDAHY, Circuit Judge.

The plaintiff, Ronald H. Selle, 
brought a suit against three brothers,
Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, 
known collectively as the popular singing group, the Bee Gees, 
alleging that the Bee Gees, in their hit tune, 
"How Deep Is Your Love," had infringed 
the copyright of his song, "Let It End." 
The jury returned a verdict in plaintiff Selle's favor 
on the issue of liability in a bifurcated trial. 
The district court, Judge George N. Leighton, 
granted the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
and, in the alternative, for a new trial. [*Selle v. Gibb,* (N.D.Ill.
1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).
We affirm the grant of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict.

## I

Selle composed his song, "Let It End," 
in one day in the fall of 1975
and obtained a copyright for it on November 17, 1975. 
He played his song with his small band 
two or three times in the Chicago area 
and sent a tape and lead sheet of the music 
to eleven music recording and publishing companies. 
Eight of the companies returned the materials to Selle; 
three did not respond. 
This was the extent of the public dissemination of Selle's song. 
[More facts at *Selle v. Gibb* (N.D.Ill.1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

Selle first became aware of
the Bee Gees' song, "How Deep Is Your Love," in May 1978 and thought
that he recognized the music as his own, although the lyrics were
different. He also saw the movie, "Saturday Night Fever," the sound
track of which features the song "How Deep Is Your Love," and again
recognized the music. He subsequently sued the three Gibb brothers;
Paramount Pictures Corporation, which made and distributed the movie;
and Phonodisc, Inc., now known as Polygram Distribution, Inc., which
made and distributed the cassette tape of "How Deep Is Your Love."

The Bee Gees are internationally known performers and creators of
popular music. They have composed more than 160 songs;  their
sheet music, records and tapes have been distributed worldwide, some of
the albums selling more than 30 million copies. The Bee Gees, however,
do not themselves read or write music. In composing a song, their
practice was to tape a tune, which members of their staff would later
transcribe and reduce to a form suitable for copyrighting, sale and
performance by both the Bee Gees and others.

In addition to their own testimony at trial, the Bee Gees presented
testimony by their manager, Dick Ashby, and two musicians, Albhy Galuten
and Blue Weaver, who were on the Bee Gees' staff at the time "How Deep
Is Your Love" was composed. These witnesses described in detail how, in
January 1977, the Bee Gees and several members of their staff went to a
recording studio in the Chateau d'Herouville about 25 miles northwest of
Paris. There the group composed at least six new songs and mixed a live
album. Barry Gibb's testimony included a detailed explanation of a work
tape which was introduced into evidence and played in court. This tape
preserves the actual process of creation during which the brothers, and
particularly Barry, created the tune of the accused song while Weaver, a
keyboard player, played the tune which was hummed or sung by the
brothers. Although the tape does not seem to preserve the very beginning
of the process of creation, it does depict the process by which ideas,
notes, lyrics and bits of the tune were gradually put together.

Following completion of this work tape, a demo tape was made. The work
tape, demo tape and a vocal-piano version taken from the demo tape are
all in the key of E flat. Lead sheet music, dated March 6, 1977, is in
the key of E. On March 7, 1977, a lead sheet of "How Deep Is Your Love"
was filed for issuance of a United States copyright, and in November
1977, a piano-vocal arrangement was filed in the Copyright Office.

The only expert witness to testify at trial was Arrand Parsons, a
professor of music at Northwestern University who has had extensive
professional experience primarily in classical music. He has been a
program annotator for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New Orleans
Symphony Orchestra and has authored works about musical theory. Prior to
this case, however, he had never made a comparative analysis of two
popular songs. Dr. Parsons testified on the basis of several charts
comparing the musical notes of each song and a comparative recording
prepared under his direction.

According to Dr. Parsons' testimony, the first eight bars of each song
(Theme A) have twenty-four of thirty-four notes in plaintiff's
composition and twenty-four of forty notes in defendants' composition
which are identical in pitch and symmetrical position. Of thirty-five
rhythmic impulses in plaintiff's composition and forty in defendants',
thirty are identical. In the last four bars of both songs (Theme B),
fourteen notes in each are identical in pitch, and eleven of the
fourteen rhythmic impulses are identical. Both Theme A and Theme B
appear in the same position in each song but with different intervening
material.

Dr. Parsons testified that, in his opinion, "the two songs had such
striking similarities that they could not have been written independent
of one another." He also testified that he did not know of two
songs by different composers "that contain as many striking
similarities" as do the two songs at issue here. However, on several
occasions, he declined to say that the similarities could only have
resulted from copying.

Following presentation of the case, the jury returned a verdict for the
plaintiff on the issue of liability, the only question presented to the
jury. Judge Leighton, however, granted the defendants' motion for
judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, in the alternative, for a new
trial. He relied primarily on the plaintiff's inability to demonstrate
that the defendants had access to the plaintiff's song, without which a
claim of copyright infringement could not prevail regardless how similar
 the two compositions are. Further, the plaintiff failed to
contradict or refute the testimony of the defendants and their witnesses
describing the independent creation process of "How Deep Is Your Love."
Finally, Judge Leighton concluded that "the inferences on which
plaintiff relies is not a logical, permissible deduction from proof of
'striking similarity' or substantial similarity; it is 'at war with
the undisputed facts,' and it is inconsistent with the proof of
nonaccess to plaintiff's song by the Bee Gees at the time in question."
[567 F.Supp. at
1183](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

## II

Both we and the district court must be reluctant to remove an issue from
the purview of the jury on either a directed verdict or a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict. Nonetheless, we have a duty to determine
whether there is sufficient evidence to support the position of the
nonmoving party, in this case, the plaintiff. The standards applicable
to a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to a directed
verdict are, of course, the same. All the evidence, taken as a whole,
must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. This
evidence must provide a sufficient basis from which the jury could have
reasonably reached a verdict without speculation or drawing unreasonable
inferences which conflict with the undisputed facts (citations omitted). 

## III

Selle's primary contention on this appeal is that the district court
misunderstood the theory of proof of copyright infringement on which he
based his claim. Under this theory, copyright infringement can be
demonstrated when, even in the absence of any direct evidence of access,
the two pieces in question are so strikingly similar that access can be
inferred from such similarity alone. Selle argues that the testimony of
his expert witness, Dr. Parsons, was sufficient evidence of such
striking similarity that it was permissible for the jury, even in the
absence of any other evidence concerning access, to infer that the Bee
Gees had access to plaintiff's song and indeed copied it.

In establishing a claim of copyright infringement of a musical
composition, the plaintiff must prove:

1. ownership of the copyright in the complaining work; 
2. originality of the work; 
3. copying of the work by the defendant, and 
4. a substantial degree of similarity between the two works. 

The only element which is at issue
in this appeal is proof of copying; the first two elements are
essentially conceded, while the fourth (substantial similarity) is, at
least in these circumstances, closely related to the third element under
plaintiff's theory of the case.

Proof of copying is crucial to any claim of copyright infringement
because no matter how similar the two works may be (even to the point of
identity), if the defendant did not copy the accused work, there is no
infringement.&hellip;  However,
because direct evidence of copying is rarely available, the plaintiff
can rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove this essential element,
and the most important component of this sort of circumstantial evidence
is proof of access.&hellip; The plaintiff may be
able to introduce direct evidence of access when, for example, the work
was sent directly to the defendant (whether a musician or a publishing
company) or a close associate of the defendant. On the other hand, the
plaintiff may be able to establish a reasonable possibility of access
when, for example, the complaining work has been widely disseminated to
the public.&hellip; 

If, however, the plaintiff does not have direct evidence of access, then
an inference of access may still be established circumstantially by
proof of similarity which is so striking that the possibilities of
independent creation, coincidence and prior common source are, as a
practical matter, precluded. If the plaintiff presents evidence of
striking similarity sufficient to raise an inference of access, then
copying is presumably proved simultaneously, although the fourth element
(substantial similarity) still requires proof that the defendant copied
a substantial amount of the complaining work. The theory which Selle
attempts to apply to this case is based on proof of copying by
circumstantial proof of access established by striking similarity
between the two works.

One difficulty with plaintiff's theory is that no matter how great the
similarity between the two works, it is not their similarity *per se*
which establishes access; rather, their similarity tends to prove access
in light of the nature of the works, the particular musical genre
involved and other circumstantial evidence of access. In other words,
striking similarity is just one piece of circumstantial evidence tending
to show access and must not be considered in isolation; it must be
considered together with other types of circumstantial evidence relating
to access.

As a threshold matter, therefore, it would appear that there must be at
least some other evidence which would establish a reasonable possibility
that the complaining work was *available* to the alleged infringer. As
noted, two works may be identical in every detail, but, if the alleged
infringer created the accused work independently or both works were
copied from a common source in the public domain, then there is no
infringement. Therefore, if the plaintiff admits to having kept his or
her creation under lock and key, it would seem logically impossible to
infer access through striking similarity. Thus, although it has
frequently been written that striking similarity *alone* can establish
access, the decided cases suggest that this circumstance would be most
unusual. The plaintiff must always present sufficient evidence to
support a reasonable possibility of access because the jury cannot draw
an inference of access based upon speculation and conjecture alone.&hellip; 

The greatest difficulty perhaps arises when the plaintiff cannot
demonstrate any direct link between the complaining work and the
defendant but the work has been so widely disseminated that it is not
unreasonable to infer that the defendant might have had access to it.&hellip; 

In granting the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, Judge Leighton relied primarily on the plaintiff's failure to
adduce any evidence of access and stated that an inference of access may
not be based on mere conjecture, speculation or a bare possibility of
access. [567 F.Supp. at 1181](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

Thus, in [*Testa v. Janssen,* (W.D.Pa.
1980),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11105954636820891332)
the court stated that:

> To support a finding of access, 
> plaintiffs' evidence must extend beyond mere speculation or conjecture. 
> And, while circumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish access, 
> a defendant's opportunity to view the copyrighted work must exist 
> by a reasonable possibility — not a bare possibility. 

Judge Leighton thus based his decision 
on what he characterized as the plaintiff's inability 
to raise more than speculation that the Bee Gees
had access to his song. 
The extensive testimony of the defendants 
and their witnesses describing the creation process 
went essentially uncontradicted, 
and there was no attempt even to impeach their credibility. 
Judge Leighton further relied on the principle 
that the testimony of credible witnesses 
concerning a matter within their knowledge 
cannot be rejected 
without some impeachment, contradiction or inconsistency 
with other evidence on the particular point at issue.&hellip; 

Judge Leighton's conclusions 
that there was no more than a bare possibility 
that the defendants could have had access to Selle's song
and that this was an insufficient basis 
from which the jury could have reasonably inferred 
the existence of access seem correct. 
The plaintiff has failed to meet even the minimum threshold of proof of the
possibility of access and, as Judge Leighton has stated, an inference of
access would thus seem to be "at war with the undisputed facts." [567
F.Supp. at 1183](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

## IV

The grant of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
might, if we were so minded, 
be affirmed on the basis of the preceding analysis
of the plaintiff's inability 
to establish a reasonable inference of access. 
This decision is also supported by a more traditional analysis
of proof of access based only on the proof of "striking similarity"
between the two compositions. The plaintiff relies almost exclusively on
the testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Parsons, that the two pieces
were, in fact, "strikingly similar." Yet formulating a
meaningful definition of "striking similarity" is no simple task, and
the term is often used in a conclusory or circular fashion.

Sherman defines "striking similarity" as a term of art signifying "that
degree of similarity as will permit an inference of copying even in the
absence of proof of access...." Sherman, *Musical Copyright
Infringement,* at 84 n. 15. Nimmer states that, absent proof of access,
"the similarities must be so striking as to preclude the possibility
that the defendant independently arrived at the same result." Nimmer,
*Copyright,* at 13-14.

"Striking similarity" is not merely a function of the number of
identical notes that appear in both compositions.&hellip; 
An important factor in analyzing the degree of similarity 
of two compositions is the uniqueness of the sections 
which are asserted to be similar.

If the complaining work contains an unexpected departure from the normal
metric structure or if the complaining work includes what appears to be
an error and the accused work repeats the unexpected element or the
error, then it is more likely that there is some connection between the
pieces.&hellip; If the similar sections are particularly intricate, then again it would
seem more likely that the compositions are related. Finally, some
dissimilarities may be particularly suspicious. *See, e.g.,* [*Meier Co.
v. Albany Novelty Manufacturing Co.,* 236 F.2d 144, 146 (2d
Cir.1956)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16559343953483366400)
(inversion and substitution of certain words in a catalogue in a "crude
effort to give the appearance of dissimilarity" are themselves evidence
of copying); [*Blume v. Spear,* 30 F. 629, 631
(S.D.N.Y.1887)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=6177442844615693296)
(variations in infringing song were placed so as to indicate deliberate
copying); Sherman, *Musical Copyright Infringement,* at 84-88. While
some of these concepts are borrowed from literary copyright analysis,
they would seem equally applicable to an analysis of music.

The judicially formulated definition of "striking similarity" states
that "plaintiffs must demonstrate that 'such similarities are of a kind
that can only be explained by copying, rather than by coincidence,
independent creation, or prior common source.'" [*Testa* (W.D.Pa.1980)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11105954636820891332).

> To prove that certain similarities are "striking," plaintiff must show
> that they are the sort of similarities that cannot satisfactorily be
> accounted for by a theory of coincidence, independent creation, prior
> common source, or any theory other than that of copying. Striking
> similarity is an extremely technical issue---one with which,
> understandably, experts are best equipped to deal.

Sherman, *Musical Copyright Infringement,* at 96.

Finally, the similarities should appear in a sufficiently unique or
complex context as to make it unlikely that both pieces were copied from
a prior common source.&hellip; 

As noted, the plaintiff relies almost entirely on the testimony of his
expert witness, Dr. Arrand Parsons. The defendants did not introduce any
expert testimony, apparently because they did not think Parsons'
testimony needed to be refuted. Defendants are perhaps to some degree
correct in asserting that Parsons, although eminently qualified in the
field of classical music theory, was not equally qualified to analyze
popular music tunes.  More significantly, however, although
Parsons used the magic formula, "striking similarity," he only ruled out
the possibility of independent creation; he did not state that the
similarities could only be the result of copying. In order for proof of
"striking similarity" to establish a reasonable inference of access,
especially in a case such as this one in which the direct proof of
access is so minimal, the plaintiff must show that the similarity is of
a type which will preclude any explanation other than that of copying.

In addition, to bolster the expert's conclusion that independent
creation was not possible, there should be some testimony or other
evidence of the relative complexity or uniqueness of the two
compositions. Dr. Parsons' testimony did not refer to this aspect of the
compositions and, in a field such as that of popular music in which all
songs are relatively short and tend to build on or repeat a basic theme,
such testimony would seem to be particularly necessary. We agree with
the Sixth Circuit which explained that "we do not think the affidavit of
[the expert witness], stating in conclusory terms that 'it is extremely
unlikely that one set [of architectural plans] could have been prepared
without access to the other set,' can fill the gap which is created by
the absence of any direct evidence of access." [*Scholz Homes, Inc. v.
Maddox* (6th Cir. 1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13045021094752392802).

To illustrate this deficiency more concretely, we refer to a cassette
tape &hellip; and the accompanying chart.&hellip; These exhibits were prepared by the defendants but introduced into evidence by the plaintiff. The tape has recorded on it
segments of both themes from both the Selle and the Gibb songs
interspersed with segments of other compositions as diverse as
"Footsteps," "From Me To You" (a Lennon-McCartney piece), Beethoven's
5th Symphony, "Funny Talk," "Play Down," and "I'd Like To Leave If I
May" (the last two being earlier compositions by Barry
Gibb). There are at least superficial similarities among
these segments, when played on the same musical instrument, and the
plaintiff failed to elicit any testimony from his expert witness about
this exhibit which compared the Selle and the Gibb songs to other pieces
of contemporary, popular music. These circumstances indicate that the
plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of proof on the issue of
"striking similarity" in its legal sense — that is, similarity which
reasonably precludes the possibility of any explanation other than that
of copying.

The plaintiff's expert witness does not seem to have addressed any
issues relating to the possibility of prior common source in both widely
disseminated popular songs and the defendants' own compositions. At oral
argument, plaintiff's attorney stated that the burden of proving common
source should be on the defendant; however, the burden of proving
"striking similarity," which, by definition, includes taking steps to
minimize the possibility of common source, is on the plaintiff. In
essence, the plaintiff failed to prove to the requisite degree that the
similarities identified by the expert witness — although perhaps
"striking" in a non-legal sense — were of a type which would eliminate
any explanation of coincidence, independent creation or common source,
including, in this case, the possibility of common source in earlier
compositions created by the Bee Gees themselves or by others. In sum,
the evidence of striking similarity is not sufficiently compelling to
make the case when the proof of access must otherwise depend largely
upon speculation and conjecture.

Therefore, because the plaintiff failed both to establish a basis from
which the jury could reasonably infer that the Bee Gees had access to
his song and to meet his burden of proving "striking similarity" between
the two compositions, the grant by the district court of the defendants'
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is  affirmed.

> At oral argument, plaintiff's attorney analyzed the degree
of similarity required to establish an inference of access as being in
an inverse ratio to the quantum of direct evidence adduced to establish
access. While we have found no authoritative support for this analysis,
it seems appropriate. In this case, it would therefore appear that,
because the plaintiff has introduced virtually no direct evidence of
access, the degree of similarity required to establish copying in this
case is considerable.

#### NOTES *Selle v. Gibb,* (7th Cir. 1984)

Ronald Selle composed “Let It End” in the fall of 1975, 
secured copyright, and played it a few times with his band in Chicago. 
Selle sent the tape and sheet music to record companies, with no luck.

Then Selle saw the hit movie *Saturday Night Fever* 
and heard “How Deep Is Your Love?” by the Bee Gees. 
Selle brought an action against the Bee Gees 
alleging copyright infringement 
and claiming that the Bee Gees must have copied Selle's "Let It End" 
in composing "How Deep Is Your Love".

Plaintiff Selle called only one expert: 
Dr. Arrond Parsons, a professor of classical music. 
Parsons had never done song comparisons. 

The jury decided in favor of plaintiff Selle, 
but the judge granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict. 
Why? No access! 
The district court said that **proof of copying is essential.** 
If no direct evidence of access, 
then inference of access may be established by striking similarity. 
But circumstantial evidence of access may be rebutted 
by evidence that the work was created independently, 
or that both copies are based on a common source in the public domain.

> Two works may be identical in every detail, 
> but, if the alleged infringer created the accused work independently 
> or both works were copied from a common source in the public domain,

## Substantial Similarity

Copyright plaintiffs must prove 
that alleged infringers had access to plaintiff's copyrighted work 
AND must prove that the infringing work is "substantially similar" 
to the copyrighted work. 
The test for "substantial similarity" is 
"whether an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy 
as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work." 
[*Warner Bros. Inc. v. ABC* (2d Cir. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11184341880970931909).

In [*Nichols v Universal* (2d Cir. 1930)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064), 
Judge Learned Hand compared a play, *Abie's Irish Rose*, 
with a movie, *The Cohens and the Kellys*, in a copyright suit.

Copyright in literary works “cannot be limited literally to the text, 
else a plagiarist would escape by immaterial variations.” 
Instead, Judge Hand formulated "the abstractions test":

> Upon any work, and especially upon a play, 
> a great number of patterns of increasing generality 
> will fit equally well, 
> as more and more of the incident is left out. 
> The last may perhaps be no more 
> than the most general statement of what the play is about, 
> and at times might consist only of its title; 
> but there is a point in this series of abstractions 
> where they are no longer protected, 
> since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his 'ideas,' 
> to which, apart from their expression, 
> his property is never extended.&hellip; 
> Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, 
> and nobody ever can. 
> In some cases the question has been treated 
> as though it were analogous to lifting a portion out of the copyrighted work; 
> but the analogy is not a good one, 
> because though the skeleton is a part of the body, 
> it pervades and supports the whole. 
> In such cases we are rather concerned 
> with the line between expression and what is expressed.”

We can see a similar analysis applied in the following case.

### *Denker v. Uhry* 

###### US District Court, SD New York (1992)

* [Case on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10458144340320727499)
* [Case on Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=820+F.+Supp.+722&appflag=67.12). 

MUKASEY, District Judge.

In these copyright infringement actions, plaintiff Henry Denker, author
of the novel *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington* and the play of the same
title, sues defendant Alfred Uhry, author of the play *Driving Miss
Daisy* and the screenplay of the same title, and others involved in the
production and distribution of the play and film versions of *Driving
Miss Daisy.* Defendants have moved jointly for summary judgment on the
issue of improper appropriation. For the reasons set forth below,
defendants' motion is granted.

#### I.

Plaintiff is a respected and prolific author. He has written 24 novels,
more than 1,000 scripts for radio and television, screenplays for three
feature films and teleplays for 12 network specials. Seven of his plays
have been produced on Broadway and two at the  Kennedy Center
for Performing Arts in Washington D.C. Plaintiff's *Horowitz and Mrs.
Washington,* the subject of these lawsuits, originally was published as
a novel in 1979 by G.P. Putnam's Sons and then as a condensed book by
Reader's Digest in 1980. Later rewritten for the stage, *Horowitz and
Mrs. Washington* had a run of seven performances at the Joshua Golden
Theater on Broadway in April 1980.

Alfred Uhry, a defendant in both actions, has been writing lyrics, plays
and screenplays since 1958. *Driving Miss Daisy,* his Pulitzer Prize
winning play, first was produced in New York by defendant Playwrights
Horizons in 1987&hellip; Adapted for the screen
by Uhry in 1988, *Driving Miss Daisy* won four Academy Awards including
Best Picture and Best Screenplay&hellip;

#### A. *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington*

Plaintiff's works depict the relationship between Samuel Horowitz, a
crusty, bigoted, 72-year-old Jewish man and Harriet Washington, his
black physical therapist. The play is set in New York City during July
1977. The action in the novel takes place over a few months sometime in
the late 1970's.

Early in the novel, and at the beginning of the play, Horowitz,
recovering from a stroke, is brought home from the hospital to his Upper
West Side apartment by his son Marvin Hammond. Immediately apparent is
Horowitz's hostility to the non-white, non-Jewish world. We learn at the
outset that he believes, notwithstanding his doctor's insistence to the
contrary, that his stroke was precipitated by an earlier mugging at the
hands of a gang of "black bastards," and that his doorman, Juan, who
refuses to accept a tip because of Horowitz's illness, is really a
"[s]hrewd little Puerto Rican ... set[ting him] up for bigger tips."

Upon arriving at his apartment, Horowitz is horrified to learn that
Marvin and his sister Mona Fields have hired Harriet Washington, a
"schvartzer," to assist in his rehabilitation. "You
can't trust them!" he warns his son. "They mug me, slash me, give me a
stroke...." Marvin, however, is
adamant, and Horowitz relents when he learns the alternative is a
nursing home.

The next few sequences in both novel and play depict Mrs. Washington's
patient but firm attempts to overcome Horowitz's hostility and proceed
with his physical therapy. Mrs. Washington, to whom Horowitz refers as
the "Black Hitler," insists that Horowitz perform a variety of tasks
designed to rehabilitate his hand and leg, including cutting his food,
crumpling newspapers, shuffling cards, walking, and buttoning his
clothes. The nature of Denker's work and its characters is illustrated
by the following exchange from the play&hellip;

> WASHINGTON: Lift your foot like this. Didn't they teach you at the
> hospital?

> \* \* \*

> HOROWITZ: And if I try I'll be able to dance in the ballet? (He barely
> raises it.) There! Better?

> WASHINGTON: No!

> HOROWITZ: Tell me, my dear Mrs. Washington, you ever had the ambition
> to run a concentration camp?

> \* \* \*

> WASHINGTON: Tomorrow will be better. And now for your occupational
> therapy.

> HOROWITZ: My occupation I already know. I used to be in wholesale
> paper and twine.

> WASHINGTON: Manual dexterity, Mr. Horowitz. Proprioceptive
> Neuromuscular Facilitation.

> HOROWITZ: There is nothing worse than an educated negro.

Despite Horowitz's offensive manner, Mrs.
Washington refuses to quit because the job allows her to help her
widowed daughter who is raising two children.

As the novel and play progress, Horowitz increasingly is impressed by
Mrs. Washington's integrity and determination, and his attitude towards
her gradually softens. During a visit to Central Park the two talk of
the loss of their respective spouses. Later Horowitz, who is saddened by
eating alone in the dining room where he used to eat with his wife, asks
Mrs. Washington if she would join him for dinner. When Mrs. Washington
agrees to have coffee while Horowitz eats, it is the first time she sees
him smile. Eventually, as the friendship develops Horowitz's racial
remarks become more humorous than hostile and he uses them, albeit
awkwardly and insensitively, in an attempt to express his growing
admiration for Mrs. Washington.

Later on in the two works, New York City erupts in rioting and looting
during a city-wide electrical blackout. The following morning, Mrs.
Washington returns to Horowitz's apartment visibly upset. Mrs.
Washington's grandson Conrad, after listening to his grandmother's
recent complaints of being unable to sleep because of the heat, tried to
steal an air conditioner and was arrested. Moved by the story, Horowitz
calls his son Marvin, a lawyer, and demands he help Conrad. When Mrs.
Washington expresses her appreciation, Horowitz replies, it is "[l]ittle
enough to do for a friend." 

A lawyer from Marvin's firm secures Conrad's release with "just a
warning." In the novel, Horowitz, Mrs. Washington and her grandchildren
celebrate by having dinner at a French restaurant and attending a
Shakespeare play in Central Park. In both the novel and play, Horowitz
gives Conrad a gold coin that he received from his father on his bar
mitzvah. He tells Conrad that when he is angered by his inability to be
helpful to his mother and grandmother the coin will serve as a reminder
that the answer is hard work. 

A week later, Conrad is stabbed. In the novel, Horowitz rushes to Harlem
Hospital, assuming that Conrad was injured in the course of a drug deal.
There he finds Mrs. Washington, sitting on a chair next to Conrad's bed,
crying. In a rage, Horowitz calls the boy an "animal" who "belongs in a
cage."&hellip; In both novel and play, the scene ends with Mrs. Washington telling
Horowitz that Conrad was stabbed when two men attempted to steal the
gold coin. In the novel, Horowitz apologizes. In the
play, Mrs. Washington storms out in anger. 

[Later that night, tired, alone and embarrassed, Horowitz deviates from
his low cholesterol diet and orders a corned beef sandwich, coleslaw,
pickles and a beer from a delicatessen. He then suffers a mild heart attack. Driven by fear, and helped by Mrs. Washington, Horowitz experiences remarkable recovery.]

At the end of the novel and play, Mrs. Washington informs Horowitz that
she must leave to care for other patients. Horowitz gives Mrs.
Washington "her pinochle winnings"—a sizable gift for her
grandchildren's education—and the two vow to remain friends. The novel's final scene occurs almost one year after Horowitz's
stroke. Unbeknownst to Horowitz, Mrs. Washington watches as he walks to
and from synagogue to honor the anniversary of his wife's death.

#### B. *Driving Miss Daisy*

Uhry's *Driving Miss Daisy* tells the story of Daisy Werthan, an
elderly, Jewish woman, and her 25-year relationship with Hoke Coleburn,
her black chauffeur. Set in Atlanta between 1948 and 1973, *Driving Miss
Daisy* is a distinctively southern story. Daisy is a refined southern
woman, who, like Horowitz, is strong-willed and struggles to maintain
her independence in the face of advancing age. Hoke, a product of the
segregated south, is uneducated but possessed of a strong sense of
dignity and, together with Daisy, adjusts to advancing age and changing
times.

Uhry's works begin with Daisy, 72 years old, inadvertently putting her
car in reverse and crashing into her neighbor's yard. In the next scene
in the film, and the first in the play, Daisy and Boolie, her
40-year-old son, argue about whether Daisy should continue to drive.
Despite his mother's protests, Boolie hires Hoke Coleburn as her
chauffeur.

Initially, Daisy ignores Hoke. She walks and takes public transportation
rather than being driven. When Hoke attempts to perform household chores
to relieve his boredom, Daisy demands that he stop. In both the movie
and the play, Hoke eventually convinces Daisy to allow him to drive her
to the supermarket. Daisy begins barking out orders from the moment she
gets into the car. She accuses Hoke of speeding although he is driving
19 miles an hour in a 35-mile-an-hour zone; she becomes panic stricken
when Hoke decides to take a more direct route to the supermarket than
the one Daisy is used to; she demands he park the car in the shade; and
she takes the keys when entering the supermarket. While Daisy is
shopping Hoke calls Boolie to tell him he drove Daisy to the market:
"Yassuh, only took six days. Same time it take the Lawd to make the
worl'."

In a subsequent scene, Daisy telephones Boolie early in the morning and
insists that he come to the house immediately. When Boolie arrives,
Daisy triumphantly displays evidence of a missing can of salmon as proof
that Hoke is stealing from her. Shortly thereafter, Hoke arrives for
work, and before either Daisy or Boolie can mention the missing salmon,
Hoke hands Daisy a new can to replace the salmon he had eaten the
previous day. An embarrassed Daisy quickly bids Boolie good-bye.

We next see Daisy tending to her husband's grave 
on what is referred to in the screenplay 
as a "full, fuzzy-green, warm morning." 
She asks Hoke, who is standing nearby, 
to put a pot of azaleas on Leo Bauer's grave. 
Hoke cannot locate the Bauer grave and, deeply embarrassed, 
is forced to admit to Daisy 
that he is unable to read. 
Daisy, formerly an elementary school teacher, 
teaches Hoke to sound out the name Bauer. 
Throughout the works Daisy helps Hoke learn to read and write.&hellip;

A few years later, we see Hoke and Boolie discussing the new car Boolie
bought for Daisy. Hoke tells Boolie he bought Daisy's old car from a
dealer. Although he could have saved money by buying it directly from
Daisy, Hoke tells Boolie "yo' mama in my business enough as it is. I
ain' studyin' makin' no monthly car payments to her. Dis mine the
regular way." 

In the film we next see Daisy and Hoke on the way to Mobile, Alabama to
visit Daisy's relatives. While they are picnicking on the side of the
road two Alabama state troopers pull over. The troopers inspect Hoke's
drivers license and the car registration. Walking away, one comments:
"An old nigger and an old Jew woman takin off down the road together.
Now that is one sorry sight." The other replies: "I'll tell you one
sorrier. They're sitting in a Cadillac and I'm sittin' next to you."

Later in the journey, Hoke tells Daisy that he has to stop the car to
"make water." When Daisy tells him to wait until they arrive. Hoke
drives on a minute and then abruptly stops the car. He tells Daisy
quietly but firmly: "I ain' no dog and I ain' no chile and I ain' jes' a
back of the neck you look at while you goin' wherever you want to go. I
am a man nearly seventy-two years old and I know when my bladder full
and I gettin' out dis car and goin' off down the de road like I got to
do. And I'm takin' de car key dis time. And that's de end of it."

We next see Hoke in Boolie's office at the Werthan Company telling
Boolie that Boolie's cousin Jeannette Lewis has offered him a job. Hoke
indicates that it "got him thinking." When Boolie offers a raise to
sixty-five dollars a week, Hoke counters with seventy-five and Boolie
agrees. As Hoke leaves Boolie's office he tells him it "feel good" to
have "people fightin' over you." 

After an unstated passage of time, we join a frightened Daisy alone in
her home during a winter ice storm. To Daisy's surprise, Hoke shows up
for work. Because they are unable to drive, Daisy asks Hoke to keep her
company for the day. He agrees and lights a fire. While Daisy "sits
contented in her chair" the focus shifts to Boolie who is calling to
check up on Daisy. He offers to visit her once the
storm subsides, but Daisy declines because Hoke is with her. When Daisy
describes Hoke as "very handy," Boolie is startled and remarks that he
has never heard his mother "say loving things about Hoke before." 

Some years later, Hoke and Daisy are caught in a traffic jam on the way
to synagogue. Hoke, who has asked a police officer, informs Daisy that
the synagogue was bombed. Distressed, Daisy vehemently insists that it
must have been the conservative or orthodox synagogue, rather than the
reform synagogue she attends, that was the intended target. Hoke
replies: "It doan' matter to them people. A Jew is a Jew to them folks.
Jes like light or dark we all the same nigger." Daisy begins to cry.

In the next sequence, Boolie tells Daisy that he cannot accompany her to
a United Jewish Appeal dinner at which Martin Luther King will be
speaking. Boolie explains that his business would be threatened if
associates believed he supported Martin Luther King, and suggests that
Daisy invite Hoke.  On the way to the dinner Daisy mentions the
ticket to Hoke. Hoke, offended by the last-minute invitation, refuses:
"Next time you ask me someplace, ask me regular.... Things changin', but
they ain't change all that much." 

Several years pass. Hoke arrives at the house to find Daisy, who is 90,
overwrought. She is searching frantically for her students' homework and
insists that she is late for school. After calling Boolie, Hoke calms
Daisy down. Daisy eventually regains her composure and tells Hoke that
he is her best friend. The scene fades with Daisy and Hoke silently
holding hands.

The final scenes take place on Thanksgiving two years later. In the
film, we first see the outside of Daisy's home with a real estate
agent's "For Sale" sign on the lawn and a "sold" sticker pasted over the
sign. Boolie, 65 years old, is walking through the house when Hoke, 85,
enters. The two briefly walk through the house and then leave to visit
Daisy who has been living at a nursing home. When they arrive the
patients are finishing their dinner. Daisy is sitting at a table
vacantly staring into space when Hoke and Boolie join her. When Daisy
does not respond, Boolie starts to make some forced small talk with
Hoke. Daisy, who either has been listening or has just become lucid,
tells Boolie that Hoke has come to see her not him and sends Boolie to
"charm the nurses."

Daisy, regaining for a moment her feisty manner, ensures that Boolie is
still paying Hoke. Hoke notices that Daisy has not eaten her pumpkin
pie. The play and movie close with Hoke carefully cutting the pie and
feeding it to her.

#### II.

\* \* \*

#### A. *Theme*

The summary judgment standard is easier stated than applied. There is no
bright line rule to distinguish between idea and expression, and in
comparing works of fiction the distinction "is especially elusive."
[*Hoehling v. Universal City Studios,* (2d Cir. 1980)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1452880530764001390)&hellip;

In the case at hand&hellip;, there are indeed similarities
between the works. Each is about an elderly, white Jewish person, who,
in the face of advancing age and resulting loss of independence,
requires the assistance of a black helper, and after initial resistance,
develops a friendship with the helper. Beyond this level of abstraction,
however, the works are markedly dissimilar.

*Horowitz and Mrs. Washington,* which spans one month in the play and
several months in the novel, tells the story of the crass, opinionated
Horowitz, who with Mrs. Washington's help quickly overcomes his
prejudice and the physical handicaps and threatened loss of independence
caused by  age. Evident throughout the work are racial tensions
as they occur in the cultural and ethnic mix of New York City. In
addition to Horowitz's overt racism, such tensions manifest themselves
in the urban problems that form the background of the work such as the
street crime that is the cause of much of Horowitz's fear and which has
taken the life of Mrs. Washington's son-in-law.

By contrast, *Driving Miss Daisy* spans 25 years in the deep south and
although plaintiff relies heavily on the fact that it too depicts the
development of a friendship between an elderly Jewish character and a
black helper, *Driving Miss Daisy* is defined by its setting. The
political and social climate in the post-war South is evident in all
aspects of the work from the character's personalities— Daisy's
refinement, Hoke's lack of education and initial subservience—to the
events that cause that relationship to develop—the bombing of the
synagogue, the racism of the state troopers, Martin Luther King's
speech. Similarly, because of the 25-year span of the work, the theme of
aging is expressed differently. Whereas Horowitz is handicapped by the
sudden onset of illness and eventually regains his independence, in
*Driving Miss Daisy* the audience sees Hoke and Daisy age slowly over
time with the inevitable result that at the works' close Daisy, unlike
Horowitz, is unable to overcome the physical effects of her advanced
age.

Plaintiff is correct in his assertion that racism is a major theme in
both *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington* and *Driving Miss Daisy.* However,
the expression of this theme differs. Horowitz is knowingly and overtly
racist, believing that the men who assaulted him and the residents of
Harlem who took advantage of the blackout to loot and riot are typical
of all blacks. Eventually, through his interaction with Mrs. Washington,
he learns "that you c[an] no more make a general rule about blacks than
you c[an] about Jews." Daisy, by contrast, resists
all suggestions that she harbors racist attitudes. When Boolie compares
her resistance to Hoke to the racism of other southern whites, she
responds: "Why, Boolie! What a thing to say! I'm not prejudiced! Aren't
you ashamed?" Yet, evident in instances such as Daisy's
inability to invite Hoke to the Martin Luther King dinner, is that Daisy
has to some extent been affected by her environment. The overt racism in
*Driving Miss Daisy* comes from outside the relationship in the attitude
of the state troopers and the bombing of synagogue and forms the
background of the work. *Driving Miss Daisy* is concerned primarily with
Daisy's growing awareness of her own attitudes and eventual ability to
recognize Hoke as a friend, set against this background. In essence,
unlike plaintiff's works, Uhry's works address the racism in a society
in addition to the racism in a particular person.

#### B. *Total Concept and Feel*

The works also differ in total concept and feel; such a difference
provides a proper basis for determining that a defendant's work does not
infringe a plaintiff's. [*Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop,* (2d Cir.),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=278412908033774123)
[*cert. denied,* (1976)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=8163016428273810663).
Despite its serious themes, *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington* is
principally a comedy. Horowitz, although a bigot, is a comedic
character. His racial and ethnic slurs, interaction with Mona, temper
tantrums and social commentary on topics ranging from detente to *The
New York Times* are used by Denker for comedic purposes as well as to
establish Horowitz's ignorance and insensitivity. By the end of the
works, as evident in the rehearsal for Mona's arrival, even the normally
proper Mrs. Washington joins in some of Horowitz's antics. By contrast,
*Driving Miss Daisy* is more of a poignant and sentimental work.
Conspicuously absent in defendants' works is the television situation
comedy tone so prevalent in *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington.*

#### C. *Plot*

Plaintiff attempts to overcome these differences in theme, setting and
tone by pointing to certain discrete similarities between the works. The
purported similarities, however, either involve unprotected *scenes a
faire*— "scenes that necessarily result from the  choice of a
setting or situation," [*Walker*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16443246039845209842)—or
are not similarities at all.

Plaintiff points out that each of the works opens with an "accident"
befalling the main character. Notwithstanding plaintiff's recommendation
that the Court "take judicial notice of the common use of the term
\`cerebral accident' to refer to a stroke", to
claim that the events are similar in that both are "accidents" is less
an argument than a pun; the events are distinct not only as expression
but also in the ideas they express. Horowitz is mugged and subsequently
suffers a stroke while Daisy inadvertently drives her car into her
neighbor's yard. These are not similar events. Further, the underlying
ideas are dissimilar. Although in both *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington*
and *Driving Miss Daisy* these events give rise to the need for a
helper, Horowitz overcomes the physical effects of the stroke whereas
Daisy's accident is the first manifestation of the aging process that
ultimately destroys her independence. Thus, at most plaintiff has
alleged that Uhry used a somewhat similar plot device to that employed
in *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington,* which does not constitute
infringement.

Similarly, plaintiff maintains that the plot device used by Uhry to
depict Hoke's devotion to Daisy is identical to that used by plaintiff
to depict Mrs. Washington's loyalty to Horowitz. In plaintiff's work,
Mrs. Washington travels to Horowitz's apartment despite a citywide power
outage and climbs 11 flights of stairs to do so. In what plaintiff
characterizes as a remarkably similar scene, Hoke reports for work
despite an ice storm and hazardous driving conditions. Although
plaintiff is correct in the sense that in both works the helper
demonstrates loyalty by traveling to work at some personal risk, such
generalized plot devices, like the so-called "accidents" discussed
above, are not entitled to copyright protection. In [*Smith v.
Weinstein,* (S.D.N.Y)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12415086356592717983).),
*aff'd without op.,* [(2d Cir. 1984),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=14278387849317213525)
both plaintiff's screenplay and defendant's allegedly infringing movie
included scenes wherein convicts escaped during a rodeo. In granting
summary judgment for defendant, Judge Sofaer reasoned that "the
development of the rodeo as an escape vehicle is protectible, but only
at a level that particularizes the general into characters, details, and
events." [*Id*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12415086356592717983).
Here defendant Uhry's use of a plot device that differs as to
"characters, details, and events" does not amount to infringement.
Plaintiff is not entitled to copyright protection for all instances of
misfortune that befall the elderly or all demonstrations of dedication
by a servant or helper.

I fail also to see a similarity in expression between Mrs. Washington
surreptitiously watching Horowitz walk to synagogue at the end of
*Horowitz and Mrs. Washington* and Hoke visiting Daisy at the nursing
home at the end of *Driving Miss Daisy.* Although both are methods of
expressing the helper's devotion, it is clear that this idea is
expressed in dissimilar fashion. In fact, the differences underscore the
authors' divergent treatment of the age theme. Mrs. Washington can watch
from afar because she has helped Horowitz regain his independence and
her assistance is no longer needed. Uhry, however, depicts age as
depriving Daisy of her independence. Hoke, himself unable to drive
because of failing eyesight, must feed his friend who, because of
physical infirmities caused by age, is unable to care for herself.

Plaintiff relies on several other similarities between the works that
amount, if anything, to similarities in general themes or ideas. For
instance, citing Daisy teaching Hoke to read and write and Horowitz
giving Mrs. Washington a check to further the education of her
grandchildren, plaintiff argues that "striking is the fact that they
[Daisy and Horowitz] assist both Hoke and Mrs. Washington in ways that
are educational." Plaintiff also points to the fact
that both Hoke and Mrs. Washington previously had worked for Jewish
families. In *Driving Miss Daisy* Uhry's only use of this fact is when
Hoke tells Boolie that he worked for Judge Stone for seven years and
finds that despite what people say, Jews are quite generous. By
contrast, it is evident in plaintiff's works that Mrs. Washington has a
genuine appreciation for Jewish culture. While in the employ of the
Rosengartens, or in the play the Schenks, Mrs. Washington took the time
not only to learn to cook traditional  dishes which she serves
to Horowitz but also to learn about Jewish culture. Plaintiff uses this
as a foil for Horowitz's racism. For instance, early in the play, Mrs.
Washington tells Horowitz a story about a *tzaddik,* a righteous
scholar, which she learned while working for the Schencks. Horowitz,
angry at what he perceives as Mrs. Washington's flippant reference to
the *tzaddik,* explains that a *tzaddik* is "[a] scholar, a philosopher,
with enormous love of all God's creatures, even the smallest." Mrs.
Washington retorts: "And the blackest?" Again, although plaintiff may
have established that the works used like themes or ideas, here the
helper's previous exposure to Jews and Judaism, the expression differs.

The remainder of the similarities alleged by plaintiff involve *scenes a
faire*—incidents or events that necessarily follow from a common theme
or setting. It is well-accepted
that copyright protection, does not extend "to \`stock' themes commonly
linked to a particular genre." [*Walker*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16443246039845209842)&hellip;

\* \* \*

Because, based on the differences discussed above, no reasonable juror
could find the works substantially similar and because the few
similarities between *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington* and *Driving Miss
Daisy* involve non-copyrightable elements of plaintiff's work, summary
judgment on the issue of improper appropriation of the work as a whole
is warranted. 

#### D. *Characters*

Nor has plaintiff established that the characters in *Driving Miss
Daisy* are substantially similar to the characters in *Horowitz and Mrs.
Washington.* The protection afforded characters depicted in a creative
work is limited&hellip; 

Ultimately, then, the inquiry, whether applied to plot or characters, is
the same: the court must determine whether defendant has so invaded
plaintiff's work as to appropriate plaintiff's expression. Expression,
as it must, remains for the most part undefined, except only as it is
distinguished  from uncopyrightable ideas or *scenes a faire,*
concepts which themselves resist precise definition or easy application&hellip;

Plaintiff contends that the following characters are substantially
similar: (1) Daisy Werthan and Samuel Horowitz; (2) Hoke Coleburn and
Harriet Washington; (3) Boolie Werthan and Marvin Hammond; and (4)
Florine Werthan and Mona Fields.

Daisy and Horowitz share certain traits. Elderly, Jewish and
strong-willed, they both mistrust their black helpers and actively
resist encroachment on their independence. These shared traits, however,
are expressed in different ways. Horowitz, aggressive, opinionated and
overbearing, is, at his most presentable, a cantankerous old man. His
overt racism and emotional outbursts pervade plaintiff's work. Daisy, by
contrast, is a refined southern woman. Unlike Horowitz, Daisy avoids
expressing her prejudices—certainly less pronounced in any event than
Horowitz's—and in fact denies that she is prejudiced at all. Further,
her reserve hinders her ability to express emotion. For instance,
although Horowitz is able quickly to refer to Mrs. Washington as a
friend, it takes Daisy much longer either to develop or perceive such
feelings for Hoke. It is not until 18 years after the relationship
begins, when Daisy is threatened with the loss of her relationship with
Hoke due to her failing health, that she can do more than refer to Hoke
as "handy" and actually call him her friend. Daisy, reserved and
unemotional, and Horowitz, combative and comedic, are by no means
substantially similar.

Nor are Mrs. Washington and Hoke substantially similar. Mrs. Washington,
educated and self-assured, is able to withstand and counter Horowitz's
repeated verbal assaults from the outset. On the other hand, Hoke, the
victim of segregation, is uneducated and lacking self-confidence, and
*Driving Miss Daisy* is, to some extent, the story of his development as
well as Daisy's. Hoke slowly develops self-confidence and progresses
gradually from his initial subservience to being able to stand up to
Daisy as in the scenes where he insists on stopping the car and taking
the key on the way to Mobile and later when he declines Daisy's
invitation to the Martin Luther King speech. The similarities referred
to by plaintiff—that they both are black, are hired to render assistance
to an elderly Jewish person, develop a friendship with their employer
and refer to having some kind of relationship with their children and
grandchildren—are broad, unprotectible character outlines; they mark
where the similarities end

\* \* \*

Because plaintiff has not established any similarities between the
characters in *Horowitz and Mrs. Washington* and the characters in
*Driving Miss Daisy* beyond unprotectible ideas and broad character
outlines, summary judgment on the issue of infringement of characters is
appropriate.

\* \* \*

For the reasons stated above, summary judgment in both actions is
warranted on the issue of improper appropriation, and the complaints are
dismissed.

SO ORDERED.

## Fair Use ##

* [Fair Use](http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html) (very short "official" explanation of fair use).

> Fair use is a DEFENSE to copyright infringement. It allows the taking of some part of a copyrighted work without the need to secure the author's permission. Examples of fair use include: news reporting, criticism, comment, teaching . . . parody, scholarship, or research.

> *Pocket Lawyer For Filmmakers,* 2nd Edition, page 245.

#### Copyright Statute

###### § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include: 

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished 
shall not itself bar a finding of fair use 
if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

#### Who decides whether use of a copyrighted work was fair?

The court does. AFTER the fact. 
Meaning that the accused infringer 
has already been hauled into court by the copyright holder. 
Attorney's fees (ka-ching!). 
This why copyright CLEARANCES and LICENSING are essential 
BEFORE the movie is made. 
Clearances are designed to keep the artist from being sued in the first place.

The Watergate Scandal forced Richard Nixon 
to resign as President of the United States in 1974. 
Vice President Gerald Ford became president, 
and thirty days later granted Nixon a full pardon 
for any crimes he may have committed while in office. 

The decision caused an outrcy in the press 
and public indignation from citizens 
(particularly Democracts) 
who wanted Nixon tried, convicted, and possibly sent to prison. 

Five years later, 
Ford published *A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford.* 
and was marketed in part as Ford's chance to explain his decision to pardon Nixon. 

In March 1979, 
weeks before Ford's publisher *Harper & Row* planned to publish *A Time To Heal,* 
an undisclosed source provided The Nation Magazine 
with Ford's unpublished manuscript. 

Working directly from the bootleg copy of the pages, 
an editor of The Nation produced a short piece entitled 
“The Ford Memoirs-Behind the Nixon Pardon.” 

The Nation piece was timed to "scoop" an article 
scheduled shortly to appear in Time Magazine. 
Time had agreed to purchase the exclusive right 
to print prepublication excerpts from the copyright holders, 
Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. ("Harper"). 
When Time found out about The Nation article, Time canceled its agreement. 

Harper sued The Nation for copyright infringement and won. 

On appeal, 
the Second Circuit reversed the lower court's finding of infringement, 
holding that The Nation's act was sanctioned 
as a “fair use” of the copyrighted material. 

The Supreme Court reversed. 
Writing for the majority 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor acknowledged 
that the Second Circuit was correct to note 
that Ford's book was "news" and mostly "facts," 
the kind of material that militates in favor of a fair use finding. 
But O'Connor placed greater emphasis 
on the author's publishing rights under &#167;106:

> The right of first publication 
> implicates a threshold decision by the author 
> whether and in what form to release his work. 
> First publication is inherently different from other §106 rights 
> in that only one person can be the first publisher; 
> as the contract with Time illustrates, 
> the commercial value of the right lies primarily in exclusivity. 
> Because the potential damage to the author 
> from judicially enforced “sharing” of the first publication right 
> with unauthorized users of his manuscript is substantial, 
> the balance of equities 
> in evaluating such a claim of fair use inevitably shifts.

The Court applied the four prongs of the &#167;107 fair use as follows:

1. The purpose and character of the use:

The Court agreed with the Second Circuit 
that The Nation's purpose in publishing the excerpts was ostensibly "news reporting," and that [§107][107] lists news reporting as one of the exemplary activities tending toward a finding of fair use. But the court insisted that the issue was not what constitutes "news," but whether a claim of newsreporting is a valid fair use defense to an infringement of *copyrightable expression*.”

As for the *character* of The Nation's use, the trial court found that The Nation knowingly exploited a purloined manuscript. The Supreme Court said that: "Fair use presupposes ‘good faith’ and ‘fair dealing,’” which was decidedly lacking in The Nation's conduct.

2. The nature of the copyrighted work:

The Court characterized "A Time to Heal" as an unpublished historical narrative or autobiography. The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy, but the Court again stressed: "The fact that a work is unpublished is a critical element of its 'nature.'"

> The right of first publication encompasses not only the choice whether to publish at all, but also the choices of when, where, and in what form first to publish a work.

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used. 

As the Court put it: 

> In absolute terms, the words actually quoted were an insubstantial portion of “A Time to Heal.” The District Court, however, found that “[T]he Nation took what was essentially the heart of the book.”

4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The Court found that "this last factor is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use." And The Nation's advanced publication of excerpts destroyed the market for first serial rights, because when Time Magazine learned of The Nation's publication it canceled the deal, and with good reason.

* [Listen to Two Live Crew's parody of "Pretty Woman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65GQ70Rf_8Y).

JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

We are called upon to decide 
whether 2 Live Crew's commercial parody 
of Roy Orbison's song, "Oh, Pretty Woman," 
may be a fair use within the meaning of the Copyright Act [§ 107][107]. 

Although the District Court 
granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew, 
the Court of Appeals reversed, 
holding the defense of fair use 
barred by the song's commercial character 
and excessive borrowing. 

Because we hold that a parody's commercial character 
is only one element to be weighed in a fair use enquiry, 
and that insufficient consideration was given 
to the nature of parody in weighing the degree of copying, 
we reverse and remand.

## I

In 1964, Roy Orbison and William Dees wrote a rock ballad called "Oh,
Pretty Woman" and assigned their rights in it to respondent Acuff-Rose
Music, Inc. &hellip; Acuff-Rose registered the song for copyright protection.

Petitioners Luther R. Campbell, Christopher Wongwon, Mark Ross, and
David Hobbs are collectively known as 2 Live Crew, a popular rap music
group. In 1989, Campbell wrote a song entitled "Pretty
Woman," which he later described in an affidavit as intended, "through
comical lyrics, to satirize the original work.&hellip;"

On July 5, 1989, 2 Live Crew's manager informed Acuff-Rose
that 2 Live Crew had written a parody of "Oh, Pretty Woman," that they
would afford all credit for ownership and authorship of the original
song to Acuff-Rose, Dees, and Orbison, and that they were willing to pay
a fee for the use they wished to make of it. Enclosed with the letter
were a copy of the lyrics and a recording of 2 Live Crew's song. 

Acuff-Rose's agent refused permission,
stating that "I am aware of the success enjoyed by 'The 2 Live
Crews', but I must inform you that we cannot permit the use of a parody
of 'Oh, Pretty Woman.'" 

Nonetheless, in 1989, 2 Live Crew released records, cassette
tapes, and compact discs of "Pretty Woman" in a collection of songs
entitled "As Clean As They Wanna Be." The albums and compact discs
identify the authors of "Pretty Woman" as Orbison and Dees and its
publisher as Acuff-Rose.

Almost a year later, 
after nearly a quarter of a million copies 
of the recording had been sold, 
Acuff-Rose sued 2 Live Crew and its record company, 
Luke Skyywalker Records, 
for copyright infringement. 

The District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew, 
reasoning that the commercial purpose of 2 Live Crew's song 
was no bar to fair use; 
that 2 Live Crew's version was a parody, 
which "quickly degenerates into a play on words, 
substituting predictable lyrics with shocking ones" 
to show "how bland and banal the Orbison song" is; 
that 2 Live Crew had taken no more than was necessary 
to "conjure up" the original in order to parody it; 
and that it was "extremely unlikely that 2 Live Crew's song 
could adversely affect the market for the original."

The District Court weighed these factors 
and held that 2 Live Crew's song made fair
use of Orbison's original. 

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded.
Although it assumed for the purpose of its opinion
that 2 Live Crew's song was a parody of the Orbison original,
the Court of Appeals thought the District Court 
had [failed to emphasize] 
that "every commercial use &hellip; 
is presumptively &hellip; unfair," 
[*Sony Corp. of America* v. *Universal City Studios, Inc.* (1984),][sony]. 
and it held that 
"the admittedly commercial nature" of the parody
"requires the conclusion" 
that the first of four factors [nature of the use] relevant under the statute 
weighs against a finding of fair use. 

Next, the Court of Appeals determined that, 
by "taking the heart of the original 
and making it the heart of a new work," 
2 Live Crew had, qualitatively, taken too much. 
Finally, after noting 
that the effect on the potential market for the original 
(and the market for derivative works) 
is "undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use," 
[*Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc.* v. *Nation Enterprises,* (1985),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950)
the Court of Appeals faulted the District Court 
for "refusing to indulge the presumption" that 
"harm for purposes of the fair use analysis 
has been established by the presumption attaching to commercial uses." 
In sum, the court concluded that its 
"blatantly commercial purpose &hellip; 
prevents this parody from being a fair use." 

We granted certiorari &hellip; to determine whether 2
Live Crew's commercial parody could be a fair use.

## II

It is uncontested here 
that 2 Live Crew's song would be an infringement
of Acuff-Rose's rights in "Oh, Pretty Woman," 
under the Copyright Act &hellip; 
but for a finding of fair use through parody. 
From the infancy of copyright protection, 
some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials 
has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright's very purpose, 
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts. . . ." 
U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. 

For as Justice Story explained:

> In truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are,
and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are
strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science
and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was
well known and used before. 

In [*Folsom* v. *Marsh,* (CCD Mass.  1841),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=4495747226837550380) Justice Story distilled the essence of law and methodology from the
earlier cases: 

> look to the nature and objects of the selections made,
the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which
the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede
the objects, of the original work.

Thus expressed, fair
use remained exclusively judge-made doctrine until the passage of the
1976 Copyright Act, in which Justice Story's summary is
discernible:

**§ 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use**

> "Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use
> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
> phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for
> purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
> (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
> the use made of a work in any particular  case is a fair use
> the factors to be considered shall include—

> 1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
> is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes;

> 2. the nature of the copyrighted work;

> 3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
> the copyrighted work as a whole; and

> 4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
> the copyrighted work.

Congress meant § 107 "to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair
use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way" and intended that
courts continue the common-law tradition of fair use adjudication.&hellip; The fair use doctrine
thus "permits [and requires] courts to avoid rigid application of the
copyright statute when, on occasion, it would stifle the very creativity
which that law is designed to foster." [*Stewart* v. *Abend* (1990)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6610856779804662857). 

The task is not to be simplified with bright-line rules, for the
statute, like the doctrine it recognizes, calls for case-by-case
analysis. [*Harper & Row*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950);
and [*Sony*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272).&hellip; The text
employs the terms "including" and "such as" in the preamble paragraph to
indicate the "illustrative and not limitative" function of the examples
given, § 101; see [*Harper & Row, supra,* at 561](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950),
which thus provide only general guidance about the sorts of copying that
courts and  Congress most commonly had found to be fair
uses. Nor may the four statutory factors be treated in
isolation, one from another. All are to be explored, and the results
weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright. 

## A

The first factor in a fair use enquiry is "the purpose and character of
the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for
nonprofit educational purposes." [§ 107(1)][107]. This factor draws on Justice
Story's formulation, "the nature and objects of the selections made." &hellip; The enquiry here may be guided by the examples given in the preamble to
§ 107, looking to whether the use is for criticism, or comment, or news
reporting, and the like, [see § 107][107]. The central purpose of this
investigation is to see, in Justice Story's words, whether the new work
merely "supersede[s] the objects" of the original creation, ("supplanting" the original), or instead adds something new, with a
further purpose or different character, altering the first with new
expression, meaning, or message; it asks, in other words, whether and to
what extent the new work is "transformative." &hellip; Although such
transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair
use, [*Sony, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272), the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally
furthered by the creation of transformative works. Such works thus lie
at the heart of the fair use doctrine's guarantee of breathing space
within the confines of copyright, see, *e. g.,* [*Sony, supra,](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272), and the more transformative the new work,
the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism,
that may weigh against a finding of fair use.

This Court has only once before even considered whether parody may be
fair use, and that time issued no opinion because of the Court's equal
division.&hellip; 
Suffice it to say now that parody has an obvious claim to transformative
value, as Acuff-Rose itself does not deny. Like less ostensibly humorous
forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on
an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one. We thus line
up with the courts that have held that parody, like other comment or
criticism, may claim fair use under § 107.&hellip; 

The germ of parody lies in the definition of the Greek *parodeia,*
quoted in Judge Nelson's Court of Appeals dissent, as "a song sung
alongside another." &hellip; Modern dictionaries accordingly describe
a parody as a "literary or artistic work that imitates the
characteristic style of an author or a work for comic effect or
ridicule," or as a "composition in prose or verse in
which the characteristic turns of thought and phrase in an author or
class of authors are imitated in such a way as to make them appear
ridiculous." For the purposes of copyright law, the nub
of the definitions, and the heart of any parodist's claim to quote from
existing material, is the use of some elements of a prior author's
composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that
author's works. &hellip; If, on the contrary, the commentary has no critical bearing on the
substance or style of the original composition, which the alleged
infringer merely uses to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in
working up something fresh, the claim to fairness in borrowing from
another's work diminishes accordingly (if it does not vanish), and other
factors, like the extent of its commerciality, loom
larger. Parody needs to mimic  an original to
make its point, and so has some claim to use the creation of its
victim's (or collective victims') imagination, whereas satire can stand
on its own two feet and so requires justification for the very act of
borrowing.&hellip; 

The fact that parody can claim legitimacy for some appropriation does
not, of course, tell either parodist or judge much about where to draw
the line. Like a book review quoting the copyrighted material
criticized, parody may or may not be fair use, and petitioners'
suggestion that any parodic use is presumptively fair has no more
justification in law or fact than the equally hopeful claim that any use
for news reporting should be presumed fair, see [*Harper & Row,* 471 U.
S., at
561](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950).
The Act has no hint of an evidentiary preference for parodists over
their victims, and no workable presumption for parody could take account
of the fact that parody often shades into satire when society is
lampooned through its creative artifacts, or that a work may contain
both parodic and nonparodic elements. Accordingly, parody, like any
other use, has to work its way through the relevant factors, and be
judged case by case, in light of the ends of the copyright law.

Here, the District Court held, and the Court of Appeals assumed, that 2
Live Crew's "Pretty Woman" contains parody,  commenting on and
criticizing the original work, whatever it may have to say about society
at large. As the District Court remarked, the words of 2 Live Crew's
song copy the original's first line, but then "quickly degenerat[e] into
a play on words, substituting predictable lyrics with shocking ones . .
. [that] derisively demonstrat[e] how bland and banal the Orbison song
seems to them." &hellip; Judge Nelson,
dissenting below, came to the same conclusion, that the 2 Live Crew song
"was clearly intended to ridicule the white-bread original" and "reminds
us that sexual congress with nameless streetwalkers is not necessarily
the stuff of romance and is not necessarily without its consequences.
The singers (there are several) have the same thing on their minds as
did the lonely man with the nasal voice, but here there is no hint of
wine and roses." &hellip;  Although the majority below had
difficulty discerning any criticism of the original in 2 Live Crew's
song, it assumed for purposes of its opinion that there was some.

We have less difficulty in finding that critical element in 2 Live
Crew's song than the Court of Appeals did, although having found it we
will not take the further step of evaluating its quality. The threshold
question when fair use is raised in defense of parody is whether a
parodic character may reasonably be perceived. Whether,
going beyond that, parody is in good taste or bad does not and should
not matter to fair use. As Justice Holmes explained:

> It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of [a work], outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At  the one extreme some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke.

* [*Bleistein* v. *Donaldson Lithographing Co.* (1903)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3277054592305773876) (circus posters have copyright protection).

While we might not assign a high rank to the parodic element here, we
think it fair to say that 2 Live Crew's song reasonably could be
perceived as commenting on the original or criticizing it, to some
degree. 2 Live Crew juxtaposes the romantic musings of a man whose
fantasy comes true, with degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex, and a
sigh of relief from paternal responsibility. The later words can be
taken as a comment on the naivete of the original of an earlier day, as
a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life
and the debasement that it signifies. It is this joinder of reference
and ridicule that marks off the author's choice of parody from the other
types of comment and criticism that traditionally have had a claim to
fair use protection as transformative works.

The Court of Appeals, however, immediately cut short the enquiry into 2
Live Crew's fair use claim by confining its treatment of the first
factor essentially to one relevant fact, the commercial nature of the
use. The court then inflated the significance of this fact by applying a
presumption ostensibly  culled from *Sony,* that "every commercial use of copy-righted material is presumptively . . . unfair. .  . ." [*Sony*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272).  In giving virtually dispositive weight to the commercial nature of the
parody, the Court of Appeals erred.

The language of the statute makes clear that the commercial or nonprofit
educational purpose of a work is only one element of the first factor
enquiry into its purpose and character. Section 107(1) uses the term
"including" to begin the dependent clause referring to commercial use,
and the main clause speaks of a broader investigation into "purpose and
character." As we explained in *Harper & Row,* Congress resisted
attempts to narrow the ambit of this traditional enquiry by adopting
categories of presumptively fair use, and it urged courts to preserve
the breadth of their traditionally ample view of the universe of
relevant evidence. [471 U. S., at
561](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950);
House Report, p. 66. Accordingly, the mere fact that a use is
educational and not for profit does not insulate it from a finding of
infringement, any more than the commercial character of a use bars a
finding of fairness. If, indeed, commerciality carried presumptive force
against a finding of fairness, the presumption would swallow nearly all
of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of § 107,
including news reporting, comment, criticism, teaching, scholarship, and
research, since these activities "are generally conducted for profit in
this country." [*Harper & Row, supra,* at
592](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950)
(Brennan, J., dissenting). Congress could not have intended such a rule,
which certainly is not inferable from the common-law cases, arising as
they did from the world of letters in which Samuel Johnson could
pronounce that "[n]o man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."
3 Boswell's Life of Johnson 19 (G. Hill ed. 1934).

*Sony* itself called for no hard evidentiary presumption. There, we
emphasized the need for a "sensitive balancing of interests," [464 U.
S., at 455, n.
40,](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272)
noted that Congress had "eschewed a rigid, bright-line approach to fair
use," &hellip; and stated that the commercial or
nonprofit educational character of a work is "not conclusive," *id.,* at
448-449, but rather a fact to be "weighed along with other[s] in fair
use decisions.&hellip; The
Court of Appeals's elevation of one sentence from *Sony* to a *per se*
rule thus runs as much counter to *Sony* itself as to the long
common-law tradition of fair use adjudication. Rather, as we explained
in *Harper & Row, Sony* stands for the proposition that the "fact that a
publication was commercial as opposed to nonprofit is a separate factor
that tends to weigh against a finding of fair use." [471 U. S., at
562](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950).
But that is all, and the fact that even the force of that tendency will
vary with the context is a further reason against elevating
commerciality to hard presumptive significance. The use, for example, of
a copyrighted work to advertise a product, even in a parody, will be
entitled to less indulgence under the first factor of the fair use
enquiry than the sale of a parody for its own sake, let alone one
performed a single time by students in school. 

##  B

The second statutory factor, "the nature of the copy-righted work," [§ 107(2)][107], draws on Justice Story's expression, the "value of the materials
used." &hellip; This factor calls for recognition that some works are closer to the core
of intended copyright protection than others, with the consequence that
fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are
copied.&hellip; We agree with both the District Court and the Court
of Appeals that the Orbison original's creative expression for public
dissemination falls within the core of the copyright's protective
purposes.&hellip; This fact,
however, is not much help in this case, or ever likely to help much in
separating the fair use sheep from the infringing goats in a parody
case, since parodies almost invariably copy publicly known, expressive
works.

## C

The third factor asks whether "the amount and substantiality of the
portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole," [§ 107(3)][107]
(or, in Justice Story's words, "the quantity and value of the materials
used," are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying. Here,
attention turns to the persuasiveness of a parodist's justification for
the particular copying done, and the enquiry will harken back to the
first of the statutory factors, for, as in prior cases, we recognize
that the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and
character  of the use. See [*Sony, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272)
(reproduction of entire work "does not have its ordinary effect of
militating against a finding of fair use" as to home videotaping of
television programs); [*Harper & Row, supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950)
("[E]ven substantial quotations might qualify as fair use in a review of
a published work or a news account of a speech" but not in a scoop of a
soon-to-be-published memoir). The facts bearing on this factor will also
tend to address the fourth, by revealing the degree to which the parody
may serve as a market substitute for the original or potentially
licensed derivatives.

The District Court considered the song's parodic purpose in finding that
2 Live Crew had not helped themselves overmuch.&hellip; The Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that:

> While it may not be inappropriate to find that no more was taken than necessary, the copying was qualitatively substantial.&hellip; We conclude that taking the heart of the original and making it the heart of a new work was to purloin a substantial portion of the essence of the original."

The Court of Appeals is of course correct that this factor calls for
thought not only about the quantity of the materials used, but about
their quality and importance, too. In *Harper & Row,* for example, the
Nation had taken only some 300 words out of President Ford's memoirs,
but we signaled the significance of the quotations in finding them to
amount to "the heart of the book," the part most likely to be newsworthy
and important in licensing serialization. [*Harper*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950). We also agree with the Court of
Appeals that whether "a substantial portion of the infringing work was
copied verbatim" from the copyrighted work is a relevant question, &hellip; for it may reveal a dearth of transformative character or
purpose under the first factor, or a greater likelihood of market harm
under the fourth; a work composed primarily of an original, particularly
its heart, with little added or changed, is more likely to be a
merely superseding use, fulfilling demand for the original.

Where we part company with the court below is in applying these guides
to parody, and in particular to parody in the song before us. Parody
presents a difficult case. Parody's humor, or in any event its comment,
necessarily springs from recognizable allusion to its object through
distorted imitation. Its art lies in the tension between a known
original and its parodic twin. When parody takes aim at a particular
original work, the parody must be able to "conjure up" at least enough
of that original to make the object of its critical wit recognizable.
See, *e. g.,* [*Elsmere Music*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17685233474069050250);
[*Fisher* v. *Dees*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16874877052780018691).
What makes for this recognition is quotation of the original's most
distinctive or memorable features, which the parodist can be sure the
audience will know. Once enough has been taken to assure identification,
how much more is reasonable will depend, say, on the extent to which the
song's overriding purpose and character is to parody the original or, in
contrast, the likelihood that the parody may serve as a market
substitute for the original. But using some characteristic features
cannot be avoided.

We think the Court of Appeals was insufficiently appreciative of
parody's need for the recognizable sight or sound when it ruled 2 Live
Crew's use unreasonable as a matter of law. It is true, of course, that
2 Live Crew copied the characteristic opening bass riff (or musical
phrase) of the original, and true that the words of the first line copy
the Orbison lyrics. But if quotation of the opening riff and the first
line may be said to go to the "heart" of the original, the heart is also
what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart
at which parody takes aim. Copying does not become excessive in relation
to parodic purpose merely because the portion taken was the original's
heart. If 2 Live Crew had copied a significantly less memorable part of
the original, it is difficult to see how its parodic character 
would have come through.&hellip; 

This is not, of course, to say that anyone who calls himself a parodist
can skim the cream and get away scot free. In parody, as in news
reporting, see [*Harper & Row,
supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950)*,*
context is everything, and the question of fairness asks what else the
parodist did besides go to the heart of the original. It is significant
that 2 Live Crew not only copied the first line of the original, but
thereafter departed markedly from the Orbison lyrics for its own ends. 2
Live Crew not only copied the bass riff and repeated it, but also produced otherwise distinctive sounds, interposing "scraper"
noise, over-laying the music with solos in different keys, and altering
the drum beat. This is not a case, then,
where "a substantial portion" of the parody itself is composed of a
"verbatim" copying of the original. It is not, that is, a case where the
parody is so insubstantial, as compared to the copying, that the third
factor must be resolved as a matter of law against the parodists.

Suffice it to say here that, as to the lyrics, we think the Court of
Appeals correctly suggested that "no more was taken than necessary," &hellip; but just for that reason, we fail to see how the copying
can be excessive in relation to its parodic purpose, even if the portion
taken is the original's "heart." As to the music, we express no opinion
whether repetition of the bass riff is excessive copying, and we remand
to permit evaluation of the amount taken, in light of the song's parodic
purpose and character, its transformative elements, and considerations
of the potential for market substitution sketched more fully below.

##  D

The fourth fair use factor is "the effect of the use upon the potential
market for or value of the copyrighted work." [§ 107(4)][107]. It requires
courts to consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the
particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also "whether
unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the
defendant &hellip; would result in a substantially adverse impact on the
potential market" for the original. [*Harper & Row*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950).&hellip; The enquiry "must take account not only of harm to the original but also of harm to the market for derivative works." [*Harper & Row*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950).

Since fair use is an affirmative defense, its proponent
would have difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating fair use
without favorable evidence about relevant markets. In
moving for summary judgment, 2 Live Crew left themselves at just such a
disadvantage when they failed to address the effect on the market for
rap derivatives, and confined themselves to uncontroverted submissions
that there was no likely effect on the market for the original. They did
not, however, thereby subject themselves to the evidentiary presumption
applied by the Court of Appeals. In assessing the likelihood of
significant market harm, the Court of Appeals  quoted from
language in *Sony* that "'[i]f the intended use is for commercial gain,
that likelihood may be presumed. But if it is for a noncommercial
purpose, the likelihood must be demonstrated.'" 972 F. 2d, at 1438,
quoting [*Sony*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272).
The court reasoned that because "the use of the copyrighted work is
wholly commercial, &hellip; we presume that a likelihood of future harm to
Acuff-Rose exists." In so doing, the court resolved
the fourth factor against 2 Live Crew, just as it had the first, by
applying a presumption about the effect of commercial use, a presumption
which as applied here we hold to be error.

No "presumption" or inference of market harm that might find support in
*Sony* is applicable to a case involving something beyond mere
duplication for commercial purposes.&hellip; *Sony*'s discussion of a
presumption contrasts a context of verbatim copying of the original in
its entirety for commercial purposes, with the noncommercial context of
*Sony* itself (home copying of television programming). In the former
circumstances, what *Sony* said simply makes common sense: when a
commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of an
original, it clearly "supersede[s] the objects," &hellip; of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it
likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur. [*Sony*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5876335373788447272).
But when, on the contrary, the second use is transformative, market
substitution is at least less certain, and market harm may not be so
readily inferred. Indeed, as to parody pure and simple, it is more
likely that the new work will not affect the market for the original in
a way cognizable under this factor, that is, by acting as a substitute
for it.&hellip; This is so because the parody and the original
usually serve different market functions. 

We do not, of course, suggest that a parody may not harm the market at
all, but when a lethal parody, like a scathing  theater review,
kills demand for the original, it does not produce a harm cognizable
under the Copyright Act. Because "parody may quite legitimately aim at
garroting the original, destroying it commercially as well as
artistically," &hellip; the
role of the courts is to distinguish between "biting criticism [that
merely] suppresses demand [and] copyright infringement[, which] usurps
it." [*Fisher* v. *Dees*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16874877052780018691).

This distinction between potentially remediable displacement and
unremediable disparagement is reflected in the rule that there is no
protectible derivative market for criticism. The market for potential
derivative uses includes only those that creators of original works
would in general develop or license others to develop. Yet the
unlikelihood that creators of imaginative works will license critical
reviews or lampoons of their own productions removes such uses from the
very notion of a potential licensing market. "People ask . . . for
criticism, but they only want praise." S. Maugham, Of Human Bondage 241
(Penguin ed. 1992). Thus, to the extent that the opinion below may be
read to have considered harm to the market for parodies of "Oh, Pretty
Woman," the court erred.&hellip;

2 Live Crew's song comprises not only
parody but also rap music, and the derivative market for rap music is a
proper focus of enquiry, see [*Harper & Row*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950) &hellip; Evidence of substantial harm to it would weigh
against a finding of fair use, because the licensing of
derivatives is an important economic incentive to the creation of
originals. See [§ 106(2)][106] (copyright owner has rights to
derivative works). Of course, the only harm to derivatives that need
concern us, as discussed above, is the harm of market substitution. The
fact that a parody may impair the market for derivative uses by the very
effectiveness of its critical commentary is no more relevant under
copyright than the like threat to the original market.

Although 2 Live Crew submitted uncontroverted affidavits on the question
of market harm to the original, neither they, nor Acuff-Rose, introduced
evidence or affidavits addressing the likely effect of 2 Live Crew's
parodic rap song on the market for a nonparody, rap version of "Oh,
Pretty Woman." And while Acuff-Rose would have us find evidence of a rap
market in the very facts that 2 Live Crew recorded a rap parody of "Oh,
Pretty Woman" and another rap group sought a license to record a rap
derivative, there was no evidence that a potential rap market was harmed
in any way by 2 Live Crew's parody, rap version. The fact that 2 Live
Crew's parody sold as part of a collection of rap songs says very little
about the parody's effect on a market for a rap version of the original,
either of the music alone or of the music with its lyrics. The District
Court essentially passed  on this issue, observing that
Acuff-Rose is free to record "whatever version of the original it
desires," &hellip; the Court of Appeals went the other way
by erroneous presumption. Contrary to each treatment, it is impossible
to deal with the fourth factor except by recognizing that a silent record
on an important factor bearing on fair use disentitled the proponent of
the defense, 2 Live Crew, to summary judgment. The evidentiary hole will
doubtless be plugged on remand.

## III

It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the commercial
nature of 2 Live Crew's parody of "Oh, Pretty Woman" rendered it
presumptively unfair. No such evidentiary presumption is available to
address either the first factor, the character and purpose of the use,
or the fourth, market harm, in determining whether a transformative use,
such as parody, is a fair one. The court also erred in holding that 2
Live Crew had necessarily copied excessively from the Orbison original,
considering the parodic purpose of the use. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

*It is so ordered.*

**An omitted (but instructive) footnote:**

> Finally, regardless of the weight one might place on the alleged infringer's state of mind, compare [*Harper & Row*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12801604581154452950) (fair use presupposes good faith and fair dealing) with [*Folsom* v. *Marsh*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=4495747226837550380) (good faith does not bar a finding of infringement); &hellip; we reject Acuff-Rose's argument that 2 Live Crew's request for permission to use the original should be weighed against a finding of fair use. Even if good faith were central to fair use, 2 Live Crew's actions do not necessarily suggest that they believed their version was not fair use; the offer may simply have been made in a good-faith effort to avoid this litigation. If the use is otherwise fair, then no permission need be sought or granted.  Thus, being denied permission to use a work does not weigh against a finding of fair use. See [*Fisher* v. *Dees* ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16874877052780018691).

### Summary of Fair Use Factors

1. The Purpose & Character of the Use.
    - Commercial use is more likely to be UNFAIR. 
    - Educational or private uses more likely to be considered fair.
    - Is there evidence of bad faith? (*Harper & Row*).
    - Is the allegedly infringing work *transformative*? (*Campbell*)
    - Transformative uses "add something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning or message" (*Campbell*).
    - Transformative uses are more likely to be fair use, and the other three factors become less important (*Campbell*).

2. Nature of the Work.
    - Spectrum of fact to fiction, where taking factual works is more fair 
taking fiction is less fair.
    - A greater latitude to disseminate historical or biographical facts than works of fiction.

3. Amount Taken
    - Some courts say that taking the entire work is presumptively unfair.
    - Taking the “heart of the work,” even if a small amount, usually isn’t fair.
    - Taking poems, song lyrics, etc. for a commercial use almost always unfair.
    - In book publishing, for nonfiction and novels, usually 250 words.
    - In music, general rule: If you sample, you license. 

4. Market Effect
    - Often cited as THE most important factor (*Harper & Row*).
    - Whether unrestricted and widespread conduct like the defendant’s would substantively and adversely impact the market, and the harm to the market for derivative works. 
    - CAUTION: Increasing demand for the underlying work doesn’t mitigate harm to a derivative market (*Harper & Row*; *Campbell*).
