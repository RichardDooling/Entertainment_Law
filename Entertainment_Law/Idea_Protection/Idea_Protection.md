## Idea Protection

If the screenwriter has not yet written the screenplay she has in mind, she is unable to rely on copyright law to protect her idea. But she wants to tell a producer about her idea in case the producer wants to hire her to write it. How can you prevent the producer from stealing the idea and developing it with someone else?

Writer Victor Desny called director-producer Billy Wilder 
to set up an appointment to meet Wilder and pitch his story idea for a movie. 
Wilder's secretary told Desny to write a synopsis describing the idea. 
Two days later, Desny called back and dictated the synopsis to the secretary. 
Desny told the secretary that he expected compensation if the idea was used, 
and she assured him that he would be paid if his idea were used. 
Wilder stole Desny's idea and made a movie called *Ace In The Hole*.

Desny sued and won because he made a deal that he would be paid 
if his idea were used. Otherwise, as the court observes, "ideas are as free as the air."

### Excerpts From *Desny v. Wilder*

###### California Supreme Court (1956)

SCHAUER, J.

[Desny completed an untitled dramatic composition based on the life of Floyd Collins. Desny called Wilder's office at Paramount and spoke to his secretary, stating that he wished to see Wilder. The secretary asked that he explain his purpose and he "told her about this fantastic unusual story," describing a story about a boy trapped in a cave. Desny asked if he could send a copy of his story to Wilder, but the secretary stated it would need to be edited down to a synopsis by the script department first. Desny told the secretary he would abbreviate it himself. Two days later, Desny called Wilder's office to inform her the synopsis was ready. The secretary asked that he read it to her over the phone so she could take it down in shorthand and Desny did so. The secretary stated she would talk it over with Wilder and get back to Desny. Desny told her Wilder could use the story only if they paid him "the reasonable value of it.&hellip;" The secretary said that if Wilder used the story, "naturally we will pay you for it." Desny only spoke to Wilder's office again in 1950 to protest the alleged use of his composition and idea in the movie *Ace in the Hole* made by Wilder. *Ace in the Hole* closely parallels both Desny's synoposis and the history and life of Floyd Collins. It also contains a fictional incident which appears in Desny's synoposis and which he claims is his creation.]

\* \* \*

It may be that plaintiff's concessions and arguments, in the light of the pleadings and evidence, are intended to suggest that there is some nebulous middle area between an abstract idea and a literary composition, wherein the idea has been cast in “concrete” form but not “concrete” enough to constitute a literary property.&hellip; 

However, for the purposes of this case at least, we find it unnecessary and undesirable to recognize any such hybrid, although we are aware that the Supreme Court of the United States has spoken of a “quasi property” right in news gathered and disseminated by a news service agency. The plaintiff here, we conclude, must stand or fall, and this case will be resolved, on rules applicable to ideas on the one hand or literary property on the other.

\* \* \*

Generally speaking, ideas are as free as the air.&hellip; 
But there can be circumstances when neither air nor ideas may be acquired without cost &hellip;  The producer may think up the idea himself, dress it and portray it; or he may purchase either the conveyance of the idea alone or a manuscript embodying the idea in the author's concept of a literary vehicle giving it form, adaptation and expression. It cannot be doubted that some ideas are of value to a producer.

An idea is usually not regarded as property, because all sentient beings may conceive and evolve ideas throughout the gamut of their powers of cerebration and because our concept of property implies something which may be owned and possessed to the exclusion of all other persons.&hellip;

\* \* \*

[W]e conclude that conveyance of an idea can constitute valuable consideration and can be bargained for before it is disclosed to the proposed purchaser &hellip; But, assuming legality of consideration, the idea purveyor cannot prevail in an action to recover compensation for an abstract idea unless (a) before or after disclosure he has obtained an express promise to pay, or (b) the circumstances preceding and attending disclosure, together with the conduct of the offeree acting with knowledge of the circumstances, show a promise of the type usually referred to as “implied” or “implied-in-fact.” &hellip; Such inferred or implied promise, if it is to be found at all, must be based on circumstances which were known to the producer at and preceding the time of disclosure of the idea to him and he must voluntarily accept the disclosure, knowing the conditions on which it is tendered &hellip; Unless the offeree has opportunity to reject he cannot be said to accept. 

\* \* \*

It is not essential to recovery that plaintiff's story or synopsis possess the elements of copyright protectibility if the fact of consensual contract be found &hellip;  Neither can we hold, on the state of the record, that plaintiff's synopsis is devoid of the elements necessary to give it some measure of such protectibility. While the trial court, or an appellate court on a sufficient record, may determine the specific extent of an author's property right in any particular work &hellip; it is unnecessary on this appeal to define the limits more exactly than has already been done.

Here, as conceded by defendants for purposes of their summary judgment motion, plaintiff, in accordance with his testimony, submitted his synopsis to them through defendant Wilder's secretary and such submission included a declaration by both plaintiff and the secretary that defendants were to pay for his story if they used it. The mere fact that at the time of plaintiff's first telephone call to Wilder's office he described the central idea of the story to the secretary in response to her insistence that he explain the purpose of his call would not as a matter of law deprive plaintiff of the right to payment for the story as discussed by him and the secretary when he again spoke with her two days later and at her request read his synopsis to her, for her to take down in shorthand for defendants' consideration; the two conversations appear to have been parts of a single transaction and must be construed as such.&hellip;

## *Montz v. Pilgrim Films & Television, Inc.*

###### United States Courts of Appeal Ninth Circuit (2011)

* [case on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3302514421955048097)

SCHROEDER, Circuit Judge:

In Hollywood, 
writers commonly submit copyrighted scripts to producers
with the understanding that if the script is used, 
the producer must compensate the writer for the use of the copyrighted material. 
But what happens when the producer uses the idea or concept embodied in the
script, but doesn't pay? The Supreme Court of California, in 1956,
answered this question by recognizing an implied contractual right to
compensation when a writer submits material to a producer with the
understanding that the writer will be paid if the producer uses the
concept. [*Desny v. Wilder* (S.Ct. 1956)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3141417353271271191).

A so-called "*Desny* claim" 
has remained viable under California law for over fifty years. 
This court applied that California law in [*Grosso v. Miramax Film Corp.* (9th Cir. 2004),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9970479884551762667) where we held that such an implied contractual claim is not preempted by federal copyright law. We
explained that the contractual claim requires that there be an
expectation on both sides that use of the idea requires compensation,
and that such bilateral understanding of payment constitutes an
additional element that transforms a claim from one asserting a right
exclusively protected by federal copyright law, to a contractual claim
that is not preempted by copyright law. *Grosso* has firm roots in our
federal law as well as in the California law. Earlier, we recognized
that a claim for unjust enrichment is essentially equivalent to a claim
of copyright infringement and is therefore preempted. 
Yet we had also recognized a claim for breach of contract that was not
preempted where the plaintiff establishes he had a reasonable
expectation of payment for use. [*Landsberg v. Scrabble Crossword Game
Players, Inc.,* (9th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9998669200720427052).

We recently followed *Grosso* in [*Benay v. Warner Bros. Entm't, Inc.,*
(9th Cir. 2010),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1156296074793113648)
and held a contractual claim was not preempted. We said that "[c]ontract
law, whether through express or implied-in-fact contracts, is the most
significant remaining state-law protection for literary or artistic
ideas." *Id.* at 629. The three judge panel in this case, however, found
a similar claim preempted.

We again hold that copyright law does not preempt a contract claim where
plaintiff alleges a bilateral expectation that he would be compensated
for use of the idea, the essential element of a *Desny* claim that
separates it from preempted claims for the use of copyrighted material.
We see no meaningful difference between the conditioning of use on
payment in *Grosso* and conditioning use in this case on the granting of
a partnership interest in the proceeds of the production. Montz, as did
the plaintiffs in *Desny* and *Grosso,* has alleged he revealed his
concept to defendants reasonably expecting to be compensated, if his
concept was used. We conclude that the district court's judgment
dismissing the contractual claim as preempted must be reversed.

Plaintiffs' complaint also alleged a claim under California law for
breach of confidence. The district court dismissed it as preempted, as
well, and the panel affirmed. We also reverse the judgment dismissing
that claim and remand both for further proceedings.

### I. Factual Background

In 1981, Plaintiff Larry Montz, a parapsychologist, conceived of an idea
for a television show that would follow a team of paranormal
investigators conducting field investigations. As envisioned, each
episode would follow the team to different real-world locations, where
they would use magnetometers, infrared cameras, and other devices to
investigate reports of paranormal activity. According to the complaint,
from 1996 to 2003, Montz and Plaintiff Daena Smoller, a publicist and a
producer, pitched Montz's idea to television studios, producers, and
their representatives, including representatives of NBC and the Sci-Fi
channel. A number of meetings and discussions took place, and Montz and
Smoller presented screenplays, videos, and other materials relating to
their proposed show. Ultimately, the studios indicated that they were
not interested.

Three years later, in November 2006, Montz and Smoller filed a complaint
against Pilgrim Films & Television, Inc., NBC Universal Inc., Craig
Piligian, Jason Conrad Hawes, and ten unknown defendants in federal
district court, alleging copyright infringement, breach of implied
contract, breach of confidence, and several other causes of action.
According to the complaint, after the meetings with Montz and Smoller,
NBC partnered with Piligian and Pilgrim to produce a series on the
Sci-Fi Channel based on the plaintiffs' materials. The show, called
*Ghost Hunters,* starred Hawes as the leader of a team of investigators
who travel across the country to study paranormal activity.

Plaintiffs' complaint specifically alleged that defendants breached an
implied-in-fact contract. The complaint described the terms of the
agreement:

> Plaintiffs communicated their ideas and creative concepts for the
> "Ghost Hunters" 
> Concept to the Defendants, pursuant to the standard custom and
> practice in the industry with respect to the exchange of creative
> ideas, under the following terms:

> a. that Plaintiffs' disclosure of their ideas and concepts was strictly
> confidential;

> b. that the Defendants would not disclose, divulge or exploit the
> Plaintiffs' ideas and concepts without compensation and without
> obtaining the Plaintiffs' consent; and

> c. that, by accepting the Plaintiffs' disclosure of its concept, the
> Defendants accepted and agreed to abide by the foregoing terms.

The complaint further alleged that plaintiffs presented
the concept on the express condition that they made the presentation as
an offer to partner with the defendants and that plaintiffs justifiably
expected to receive a share of the profits derived from any use of the
idea:

> The Plaintiffs presented their ideas for the "Ghost Hunter" Concept to
> the Defendants' [sic] in confidence, pursuant to the custom and
> practice of the entertainment industry, for the express purpose of
> offering to partner with the Defendants in the production, broadcast
> and distribution of the Concept. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs
> justifiably expected to receive a share of any profits and credit that
> might be derived from the exploitation of its ideas and concepts for
> the Concept.

The dissent appears to overlook these clear allegations
that compensation was expected in accord with industry practice.

Plaintiffs also alleged that defendants breached their confidential
relationship "by taking Plaintiffs' novel ideas and concepts, exploiting
those ideas and concepts, and profiting therefrom to the Plaintiffs'
exclusion.&hellip;" The complaint therefore alleged a claim
under California law of breach of confidence.

### II. Procedural Background

Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(6) &hellip; The district court granted in part and denied in part the
defendants' motion. The court concluded that the complaint alleged facts
sufficient to state a federal copyright claim, but that federal
copyright law preempted the plaintiffs' state-law claims. The court
dismissed the state-law claims with prejudice and without leave to
amend.

Plaintiffs amended their copyright claim and added Universal Television
Networks as a defendant. Subsequently, the parties stipulated to the
voluntary dismissal of the amended copyright claim with prejudice. With
no remaining claims to be adjudicated, the district court entered final
judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs timely appealed the
dismissal of their breach of implied contract and breach of confidence
claims.

On June 3, 2010, the three-judge panel affirmed, holding both claims
preempted by federal copyright law. [*Montz v. Pilgrim Films &
Television, Inc.,* (9th Cir. 2010)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8201668797759697176).
We ordered a rehearing of this case en banc pursuant to a vote of the
majority of active judges. 

### III. California Implied-in-Fact Contract Law

Writers in the Hollywood film industry often submit scripts to producers, 
or set up meetings with them, in the hope of selling them scripts and concepts for movies. 
The practice has carried over into television. 
Since the writer is looking for someone to turn the written work into an
entertainment production, writers often pitch scripts or concepts to
producers with the understanding that the writer will be paid if the
material is used. Since an idea cannot be copyrighted, a concept for a
film or television show cannot be protected by a copyright. But the concept can still be stolen if the studio violates an implied contract to pay the writer for using it.

In *Desny,* the California Supreme Court recognized that a writer and
producer form an implied contract under circumstances where both
understand that the writer is disclosing his idea on the condition that
he will be compensated if it is used. [*Desny*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3141417353271271191).
There, defendant Billy Wilder, famed director of *Sunset Boulevard* and
*Witness for the Prosecution,* allegedly entered into an implied
contractual arrangement that was initiated when the plaintiff telephoned
Wilder's office and pitched a movie idea to Wilder's secretary who,
along with Wilder, understood Wilder was to pay if he used the story.
*Id.* at 273-74. Wilder produced a film, *Ace in the Hole,* allegedly
based on the idea plaintiff had pitched for a movie inspired by the
"life story of Floyd Collins who was trapped [in a cave] and made
sensational news for two weeks." *Id.* at 262. Wilder allegedly failed
to compensate the plaintiff, and the California Supreme Court held that,
given the entertainment industry norms, the plaintiff had sufficiently
pled the breach of an implied contract to pay for use of his idea. The
issue here is whether copyright law now preempts such claims.

### IV. Copyright Preemption

The Copyright Act of 1976 expressly preempts state claims where the
plaintiff's work "come[s] within the subject matter of copyright" and
the state law grants "legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to
any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright."
&hellip;[T]he scope of copyright subject matter does not extend to
ideas that are not within a fixed medium. Section 301(b) specifically
excludes non-fixed ideas from the Copyright Act's scope; the statute
describes "works of authorship not fixed in any tangible medium of
expression" as "subject matter that does not come within the subject
matter of copyright." 17 U.S.C. § 301(b). Ideas that are still purely
airborne are thus not even within the subject matter of copyright. Once
an idea has been written down or otherwise recorded, however, we have
recognized that it satisfies the Copyright Act's writing requirement
because it is fixed in a tangible medium. 

For preemption purposes, ideas and concepts that are fixed in a tangible
medium fall within the scope of copyright. &hellip;[F]ixed ideas falls
within the subject matter of copyright and thus satisfies the first
prong of the statutory preemption test, despite the exclusion of fixed
ideas from the scope of actual federal copyright protection.

Accordingly, the major focus of litigation has been on the second prong
of the preemption test: whether the asserted state right is equivalent
to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright.
To survive preemption, a state cause of action must assert rights that
are qualitatively different from the rights protected by copyright. In
*Grosso,* we held that the rights created under California law emanating
from *Desny* were qualitatively different from the rights protected by
federal copyright law because a *Desny* claim includes an added element:
an agreement to pay for use of the disclosed ideas. Contract claims generally survive preemption because they require proof of such an extra element. 

The California Courts of Appeal have uniformly concluded that *Desny*
claims are not preempted because they flow from agreements and
understandings different from the monopoly protection of copyright law.
The California decisions focus on the personal nature of the
relationship formed in idea submission cases: "The creation of an
implied-in-fact contract between an author, on the one hand, and an
agent, producer, or director, on the other hand, is of such a personal
nature that it is effective only between the contracting parties."
[*Rokos,* 182 Cal.App.3d at 617, 227 Cal.Rptr.
480](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11352233580490761830)
(citing [*Chandler v. Roach,* 156 Cal.App.2d 435, 441, 319 P.2d 776
(1957)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12795840117616573798)).
Thus, it is unlike a copyright that is a public monopoly. The rights protected
under federal copyright law are not the same as the rights asserted in a
*Desny* claim, and the California state courts have recognized this
consistently over the decades.

In recent years, litigation has, not surprisingly, moved to the federal
courts where defendants have hoped for greater success in pressing for
copyright preemption&hellip;

In a later case, however, a district court held that an implied-in-fact
contract claim survived Copyright Act preemption because it was
substantively different from a copyright claim: "[T]he whole purpose of
the contract was to protect Plaintiff's rights to his ideas beyond those
already  protected by
the Copyright Act. . . ." [*Groubert v. Spyglass Entm't Group,* (C.D.Cal. July 23, 2002)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=5654145615804941089).
Nimmer expressly approved this decision. We
agreed with this assessment when we decided in *Grosso* that copyright
law does not preempt an implied contractual claim to compensation for
use of a submitted idea. We reaffirm that rule today.

\* \* \*

Plaintiffs' claim for breach of confidence also survives copyright
preemption. The claim protects the duty of trust or confidential
relationship between the parties, an extra element that makes it
qualitatively different from a copyright claim. 

### V. Sufficiency of the Complaint as to the Breach of Implied Contract and Breach of Confidence Claims

Defendants argue that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to
make out a claim for breach of implied contract. They assert that it
lacks any allegation (1) that Montz and Smoller disclosed their idea for
sale, (2) that they expected to be reasonably compensated for the idea,
and (3) that defendants knew the conditions on which it was offered. Yet
the complaint makes all three allegations and closely tracks the
complaint we found sufficient in *Grosso.*

Defendants similarly argue that Montz and Smoller failed to allege
sufficient facts to make out their claim for breach of confidence. They
argue that there is no allegation (1) that plaintiffs disclosed
"confidential and novel information," and (2) that defendants knew it
was supposed to be kept confidential. But the complaint clearly contains these allegations as well.

### VI. Conclusion

The judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the matter REMANDED
for further proceedings on plaintiffs' remaining claims.

### *Montz* Dissents

O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, Joined by GOULD, TALLMAN and BEA, Circuit
Judges, dissenting:

Montz does not claim to have sold his rights as a copyright owner. To
the contrary, he alleges that he retained those rights, and that Pilgrim
implicitly promised 
*not* to use or to disclose his ideas *without his consent.* As the
district court properly held, an action to enforce a promise not to use
or to disclose ideas embodied in copyrighted material without
authorization asserts rights equivalent to those protected by the
Copyright Act. Accordingly, the district court's determination that the
Copyright Act preempts Montz's claims should be affirmed. I respectfully
dissent from the Court's opinion to the contrary.

### I

 &hellip;

I shall address only the second prong [of the preemption analysis]: whether Montz's claims are "equivalent" to the exclusive rights afforded to copyright owners by section 106.

#### A

Montz's breach-of-implied-contract claim consists of the following
allegations: (1) "[t]he Plaintiffs presented their ideas for the 'Ghost
Hunter' Concept to the Defendant in confidence, pursuant to the
custom and practice of the entertainment industry, for the express
purpose of offering to partner with the Defendants in the production,
broadcast and distribution of the Concept," (2) "by accepting the
Plaintiffs' disclosure of its concept," the defendants agreed that they
"would *not* disclose, divulge or exploit the Plaintiffs' ideas and
concepts without compensation and *without obtaining the Plaintiffs'
consent,*" (3) "the Plaintiffs justifiably expected to receive a share
of any profits and credit that might be derived from the exploitation of
[their] ideas and concepts," and (4) "by producing and broadcasting the
Concept," "[t]he Defendants breached their implied agreement not to
disclose, divulge or exploit the Plaintiffs' ideas and concepts *without
the express consent of the Plaintiffs,* and to share with the Plaintiffs
. . . the profits and credit for their idea and concepts." (emphasis
added).

To distinguish itself from a copyright claim, a state law claim "must
protect rights which are qualitatively different from the copyright
rights." [*Laws* at
1143](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16156934007444564709)
(internal quotation marks omitted). This requires that the state claim
have an "extra element which transforms the nature of the action." *Id.*
(internal quotation marks omitted). Montz's breach-of-implied-contract
claim fails this test.

Under section 106, a copyright owner has the exclusive rights to
reproduce, to distribute, and to display the copyrighted work, as well
as to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C.
§ 106. Section 106 also provides a copyright owner with the exclusive
rights  to authorize
such reproduction, distribution, display, and preparation. *Id.* Montz
alleges that "by producing and broadcasting" *Ghost Hunters,* "[t]he
Defendants breached their implied agreement not to disclose, divulge or
exploit the Plaintiffs' ideas and concepts without the[ir] express
consent." In other words, Montz asserts that Pilgrim produced and
broadcast a television program derived from Montz's screenplays, video,
and other materials *without authorization.* These rights are equivalent
to the rights of copyright owners under section 106—namely, the
exclusive rights to authorize reproduction, distribution, and display of
original works, and to authorize preparation of derivative works. 

#### B

With respect, I suggest the majority does not appreciate the
significance of Montz's refusal to authorize Pilgrim to use the ideas
embodied in his materials. This is not the same as
authorizing Pilgrim to use his ideas so long as it pays him. A copyright
is not just the right to receive money upon the use of a work; it is
"the right to control the work, including the decision to make the work
available to or withhold it from the public." [*Laws* at
1137](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16156934007444564709). Indeed, because a
copyright gives its owner a property right—not merely a liability
right—injunctive relief for copyright infringement is provided for by
Congress, and is routinely granted by courts. 

To be sure, many copyright owners choose to sell the right to control
their work. But a copyright holder may turn down money—or accept less
money—in exchange for retaining more control over, and more involvement
with, his work. For instance, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck famously
refused to sell the rights to *Good Will Hunting* until they were
promised starring roles in the film. Such is
the case here: Montz did not offer to sell his idea to Pilgrim; he
offered "to partner" with Pilgrim in the show's "production and
distribution." And when that offer was refused, Montz received an
implied promise that Pilgrim would not use the ideas embodied in his
materials without his consent.

Thus, Montz does not claim to have sold the rights to the ideas embodied
in his materials, as did the plaintiff in [*Grosso v. Miramax Film
Corp.,* (9th Cir.2004)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9970479884551762667).
*Grosso* involved a particular type of breach-of-implied-contract claim,
the elements of which the California Supreme Court elucidated in [*Desny
v. Wilder,* (1956)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3141417353271271191).
To state a *Desny* claim, the plaintiff must plead that he "prepared the
work, disclosed the work to the offeree for sale, and did so under
circumstances from which it could be concluded that the offeree
voluntarily accepted the disclosure knowing the conditions on which it
was tendered and the reasonable value of the work." [*Grosso,* at
967](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9970479884551762667).

"[M]irror[ing] the requirements of *Desny,*" the complaint in *Grosso*
alleged the plaintiff had submitted a movie script to the defendants
"with the understanding and expectation . . . that [he] would be
reasonably compensated for its use by Defendants." *Id.* (internal
quotation marks omitted). We concluded that the defendants' "implied
promise to pay" for use of the idea embodied in the script constituted
"an \`extra element' for preemption purposes." *Id.* at 968. The subject
of the implied contract, then, was the sale of the plaintiff's idea. The
plaintiff asserted that he had "disclosed [his] work to the offeree for
sale," and that, by using the ideas embodied in his work, the offeree
had implicitly agreed to pay for it. *Id.* at 967.

By contrast, Montz alleges that he retained his rights as a copyright
owner. Montz "presented [his] ideas for the \`Ghost Hunter' Concept to
the Defendants[ ] . . . for the express purpose of offering to partner
with the Defendants in the production, broadcast and distribution of the
Concept." Pilgrim rejected the offer but allegedly promised implicitly
not to use Montz's ideas "without [his] consent." Therefore, according
to the complaint, Pilgrim did not promise to pay for the use of Montz's
ideas. Rather, it promised (implicitly) to respect Montz's rights to the
production, distribution, and broadcast of his work. Put differently, it
promised to respect the rights afforded to Montz by the Copyright Act.

The majority asserts that there is "no meaningful difference between the
conditioning of use on payment in *Grosso* and conditioning use in this
case on the granting of a partnership interest in the proceeds of the
production." This was never the issue. The *Montz*
panel did not rely on the difference between seeking compensation in the
form of a lump sum versus a percentage of profits. Rather, it relied on
the difference between authorizing the use of one's work in exchange for
money, and not authorizing the use of one's work at all. I am mindful of Montz's
allegation that he expected to receive compensation and credit if his
ideas were ever used. But this fact alone is not sufficient to
"transform the nature of the action." [*Laws* at
1144](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16156934007444564709).
Montz expected to receive compensation and credit for use of his work
only because he also expected—as any copyright owner would—that his work
would not be used without authorization. Far from being
"transformative," entitlement to compensation and credit under the
implied contract was merely the result of the contract's prohibition
against unauthorized use of Montz's work. There is thus nothing in the
complaint that "qualitatively distinguish[es]" the
breach-of-implied-contract claim from a copyright claim.
*Id.*

#### C

The majority insists that by limiting implied contract protection to
those who authorize the use of their work in exchange for consideration,
"the dissent misses the point." But it is not clear
just what point I am missing. If the point is to fill "the gap that
would otherwise exist between state contract law and copyright law,"
*id.* at 981, then I suggest that a focus on authorization is entirely
appropriate. Where a copyright owner authorizes the use of his work, but
does not receive the consideration he was promised, he has a contract
claim; where a copyright owner does not authorize the use of his work,
but, nonetheless, someone uses it to produce a substantially similar
work, he has a copyright claim.

If, however, "the point" is to provide greater protection against the
unauthorized use of copyrighted material than is afforded under the
Copyright Act, then it is a point I am glad to miss, as it is
inconsistent with the objectives of Congress. The Copyright Act strikes
a balance between the property rights of copyright owners, and the
expressive rights of the rest of the creative community, by permitting
copyright suits only where "there is substantial similarity between the
protected elements" of the two works. [*Benay v. Warner Bros. Entm't,
Inc.,* (9th Cir.2010)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1156296074793113648).
Here, Montz attempts to use an implied contract claim to do what the
Copyright Act does (i.e., to protect the unauthorized use of copyrighted
materials). The only difference is that Montz's implied contract claim
would protect those rights more broadly because California implied
contract law does not require as strict a showing of substantial
similarity as federal copyright law. But the "fact that the state-created right is . . . broader . . . than its federal counterpart will not save it from pre-emption." 

### II

Montz's breach-of-confidence claim also asserts rights equivalent to the
rights protected by the Copyright Act. The complaint states that "the
Plaintiffs' disclosure of their ideas and concepts [was] strictly
confidential," and that "[b]y taking the Plaintiffs' novel ideas and
concepts, exploiting those ideas and concepts, and profiting therefrom
to the Plaintiffs' exclusion, the Defendants breached their confidential
relationship with the Plaintiffs." Such claim simply echoes the
allegations of the breach-of-implied-contract claim. Indeed, the alleged
breach-of-confidence stems from the alleged violation of the very rights
contained in section 106—the exclusive rights of copyright owners to use
and to authorize use of their work.

The majority relies on two elements to distinguish the rights asserted
in Montz's breach-of-confidence claim from the rights protected by the
Copyright Act. First, the breach-of-confidence claim requires Montz to
show that Pilgrim disclosed confidential material (i.e., the ideas
embodied in  Montz's
materials) to third parties. Maj. op. at 981-82. But a copyright affords
its owner the same right: the right against unauthorized disclosure of
copyrighted work. 
Second, the breach-of-confidence claim requires that Montz show Pilgrim
breached a confidential relationship or entrustment. Maj. op. at 981-82.
Yet a breach of a relationship of trust does not, by itself, transform
the nature of an action. The
breach-of-confidence claim still asserts rights protected by the
Copyright Act; the only difference is that the rights are asserted
against a particular person (i.e., someone with whom the copyright
holder had a confidential relationship). But the right against
unauthorized disclosure of copyrighted work already applies against
everyone, regardless of whether one had a confidential relationship with
the copyright holder.

Because Montz's breach-of-confidence claim is not qualitatively
different from a copyright claim, it is preempted.

### III

Montz does not allege that he sold the ideas embodied in his *Ghost
Hunters* materials to Pilgrim and that Pilgrim simply failed to make
good on its promise to pay. Instead, he alleges that Pilgrim used the
ideas embodied in Montz's copyrighted material without his permission.
Because the Copyright Act protects such equivalent rights, I
respectfully dissent.

GOULD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:

I join Judge O'Scannlain's dissent. I emphasize my concern with the
improvident practical results that the majority decision will likely
engender. The "extra element" argument is impractical for an "implied"
claim like this. Although an express contract claim can proceed under
state law, courts should be cautious about implying a contract claim in
circumstances where the claim functionally looks like a copyright claim. There is no virtue in permitting a
supplemental state law jurisdiction that in substance expands federal
copyright law.

Under such a legal regime, film production and network companies face
the chaotic prospect of having to meet conflicting federal and state
standards on essentially the same question, a result the Copyright Act
aimed to avoid. Studio and network ventures need stable law that does
not unsettle expectations. The majority's decision, however, will lead
to uncertainty by making state law—with its ambiguity, variability, and
volatility—available to litigants who bring nebulous state law claims
that in substance assert rights in the nature of copyright. Hence, I
respectfully dissent.
