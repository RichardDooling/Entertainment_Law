# First Amendment - Indecency

Just as we get comfortable with the notion of categories, 
and the notion that speech is either protected or unprotected under the First Amendment, 
along comes a category of speech the Federal Communications Commission wishes to REGULATE but not BAN. 

Please listen to [George Carlin's 7 Dirty Words routine][7dirty], 
which is the subject of the litigation in *FCC v. Pacifica*. 

Then read these two cases in their entirety. 
Keep your eye on the ball: 
Is George Carlin's routine protected speech? 
When U2's Bono says, "This is really really fucking brilliant" 
during a prime time TV broadcast at the 2003 Golden Globe awards, is that obscene?
