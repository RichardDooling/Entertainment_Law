# Lawyers For The Talent

###### By Richard Dooling

I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Nebraska College of Law. I also teach an undergraduate course at the University, which might be called Entertainment Law for Artists.

* [My Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dooling).

This is a public repository of the files I use to teach Entertainment Law. Since it's open to all, please read the following:

### I Disclaim

I am an author and sometimes a screenwriter. 
I'm also a lawyer, 
and I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Nebraska College of Law, 
but I am not YOUR lawyer, and the text you find here is NOT legal advice. 

To paraphrase Hunter Thompson: 

> The entertainment industry 
> is a cruel and shallow money trench &hellip; a long plastic 
> hallway where thieves and pimps run free 
> and good men die like dogs.

It's no place to be guessing about your legal rights. 
If you need legal advice, GET A LAWYER! 

These materials are published under an [MIT license](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Entertainment_Law/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Open Source Scholarship

If all goes well, the files in this GitHub repository will grow into an open source Entertainment Law textbook. I hope to entice collaborators: students, former students, entertainment lawyers, artists, and other professors, who may find these materials useful and help me improve them. (At the moment, I am especially interested in a collaborator or contributor with experience working in the music industry.) 

Whenever possible, I link to free content, including Wikipedia, YouTube, [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), the [SCOTUS blog](http://www.scotusblog.com/), and other notable resources that are not behind paywalls. For the convenience of law students with Westlaw accounts, I often provide links to cases on Westlaw, but whenever possible I also provide a link to the same case on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), or to the opinion itself as published by the court.

### Files & Folders

You don't need to know Markdown or computer programming to use or view these files. Public repositories (like this one) can be browsed and the files can be downloaded by anyone. If you are a student looking to download or view the Entertainment Law files, just find the files you want and download them.

Each folder contains three files, all named after the folder:

* one Markdown file (.md)
* one Word file (.docx)
* one PDF file (.pdf)

All files contain the same content, just in different formats. For example, the Introduction folder contains three files:

* Introduction.md
* Introduction.docx
* Introduction.pdf

If you click on the Markdown file (Introduction.md) you can view it as you would a webpage. 

If you click on the Introduction.docx or Introduction. pdf, you can't view the files, but you can download them if you click on the button that says "Raw." (Clicking on "View Raw" gives an error.)

### Download Zip

If you would like to download ALL of the files in this repository, look for the two buttons at the bottom of the right sidebar: "Clone in Desktop" and "Download Zip".

If you click on the "Download Zip" button, you will download a zip file containing all the files in this repository. Probably not so bad at first, but over the course of the semester more files will be added. You'll have a version problem, which is why Git and GitHub were invented. 

### Cloning

Consider investing a little time and learning how to "clone" the entire repository in your desktop. If you click on "Clone in Desktop" you will download the GitHub program, and you will be asked to create a free GitHub account. Using a simple GitHub app you will be able to quickly fetch the latest versions of these files to your computer using a simple free application available at [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

### Contributing

No obligation here. Only for the curious, but if you get interested in how GitHub works and how to contribute to this project, sign up at the [GitHub site](https://github.com/) and then read the [CONTRIBUTIONS](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Entertainment_Law/blob/master/CONTRIBUTIONS.md) and [HELP](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Entertainment_Law/blob/master/HELP.md) pages.

#### Typos, Glitches

If you spot a typo or formatting glitch please [submit an issue.](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Entertainment_Law/issues). 

On the [Entertainment Law repository page](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Entertainment_Law), on the right, click on the "Issues" link and describe the problem. If need be, copy in text illustrating the problem.

Issues are easy to submit, and you'll be making the text better for those who come after you.

Thank you,

Richard Dooling
