# Copyright Registration 

###### For Authors & Writers 

## I Disclaim

I am an author and sometimes a screenwriter. 
I'm also a lawyer, 
and I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Nebraska College of Law, 
but I am not YOUR lawyer, and the text you find here is NOT legal advice. 

To paraphrase Hunter Thompson: 

> The entertainment industry 
> is a cruel and shallow money trench &hellip; a long plastic 
> hallway where thieves and pimps run free 
> and good men die like dogs.

It's no place to be guessing about your legal rights. 
If you need legal advice, GET A LAWYER! 

## What Is Copyright?

Copyright is a form of "intellectual property." 
Like "real property" or land, 
intellectual property may be bought and sold, 
used and borrowed. 
Consider the following examples. 

Amy Author owns a plot of land 
called The Hundred Acre Wood. 
Not being a lawyer, 
Amy tends to think of The Hundred Acre Wood 
as something she either owns or doesn't own. 
If she doesn't own it, maybe she rents it.  

Amy's lawyer is trained to think of The Hundred Acre Wood 
not just as a thing that Amy owns or doesn't own, 
but as a bundle of rights (similar to a bundle of sticks).
These rights are associated with The Hundred Acre Wood. 

Each stick in Amy's bundle is a land right 
that Amy can sell or lend to others, 
or she can sell them all at once to one person. 

Consider three simple hypothetical sticks or rights 
in Amy's Hundred-Acre-Wood bundle:

1. Amy rents ten acres of The Hundred Acre Wood 
to a farmer for two years; 
2. Amy sells the right to drill for natural gas 
beneath The Hundred Acre Wood 
to a fracking company; 
3. Amy sells "an easement" to a telecom company, 
so it can bring its trucks and equipment 
into The Hundred Acre Wood, 
bury a fiberoptic cable, 
and maintain it indefinitely.

Does Amy still own the Hundred Acre Wood? 
Of course, 
but now that she has sold certain rights to the land, 
ownership is more complicated. 

Does the farmer own The Hundred Acre Wood? 
No, but Amy has sold him *the right* 
to use ten acres of her land for two years. 
Do the fracking company and the telecom company *own* The Hundred Acre Wood? 
No, but again they have paid Amy for various *rights* 
to use or occupy her land. 

What if somebody wants to buy the Hundred Acre Wood,  
but they don't want frackers or fiberoptic cable workers on their land?
What sort of "license" did Amy give the frackers and the cable workers?

Is there a public record of Amy's land ownership? Yes. 
Anybody can do a title search at the register of deeds 
and see who owns The Hundred Acre Wood. 

## Intellectual Property

Now Amy builds a cabin deep in the Hundred Acre Wood, 
where she writes a novel called *Zombies & Vampires*. 

The Hundred Acre Wood is real property 
consisting of the land 
and a bundle of Amy's rights protected by property law. 
Amy's novel is "intellectual property" 
consisting of her writing and a bundle of rights protected by the U.S. copyright laws. 

The first copyright law was the Statute of Anne, 
created by an Act of Parliament passed in England in the year 1710. 

In 1790, the Framers of the U.S. Constitution had the same idea in mind when they drafted Article I, section 8, which says:  

> The Congress shall have power &hellip; 
> To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, 
> by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors 
> the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

The Consititution grants Congress many powers 
(to raise armies, to declare war, to coin money), 
but the only BUSINESS explicitly protected by the Constitution 
is the intellectual property business. 
Nice for authors, artists and inventors!

Congress wasted no time exercising its new power 
and passed the first U.S. copyright law in 1790. 
The last major overhaul of these laws was the Copyright Act of 1976. 

The copyright laws describe and protect 
the bundle of rights Amy owns in her novel *Aliens and Zombies.* 
Consider just three simple hypothetical sticks or rights 
contained in the bundle of rights Amy owns.

1. Amy (via her literary agent) grants Random House the right to print and sell hardback copies of *Zombies & Vampires* in English in North America in exchange for standard royalties of 15% and an advance against royalites of $50,000.
2. Amy (via her literary agent and a foreign sub-agent) grants the Japanese publisher Kodansha the right to print and sell paperback copies of *Aliens & Vampires* in Japanese in Japan in exchange for royalties amounting to 10% of the cover price and an advance of $15,000.
3. Amy (via her literary agent and her Hollywood sub agent) gives Pete Producer an option to develop the film rights of *Zombies & Vampires* for 18 months in exchange for $20,000. 

Does Amy still own the copyright to her novel *Zombies & Vampires*? 
Yes. Does Random House own the copyright to Amy's novel? 
No, but Amy gave Random House a LICENSE 
to copy, print, and sell her books in English in North America. 
Likewise neither the Japanese publisher nor Pete Producer "own" the rights to Amy's novel, Amy has given them permission to exploit certain rights on her behalf.

Is there a public record of Amy's land ownership? Yes. 
Anybody can do a title search at the register of deeds 
and discover who owns the Hundred Acre Wood.

Likewise, anybody can visit the [public catalog 
of the United States Copyright Service][copyright_search] 
and do a search to see who owns the copyright *Zombies & Vampires.* 

## Authors vs. Writers

For convenience, 
let's call people who write and publish books AUTHORS. 
Let's call people who write "works for hire" WRITERS 
(screenwriters, journalists, composers of corporate newsletters, gag writers). 

Let's use those makeshift definitions 
to explore how the copyright laws treat authors and writers under copyright law.
Begin with copyright ownership 
and the all important question: Who owns the rights? 
The copyright laws put it this way: 

> COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP ["vests initially in the author or authors of the work."][201] 

*Authors* own the copyright to the works they create, 
from the moment those works are created.
This makes sense. 
The author writes a poem; the author owns the copyright to the poem. 

If the author writes a poem *with* another author, 
they create a [joint work][201], 
and both authors are coowners of the copyright in the poem. 

Not so with writers 
(again using our definition as a writer of works made for hire).
If the writer is a hired gun paid to create a "work made for hire," 
the copyright laws say that 
["the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared"][201] 
is considered the author of the copyrighted work. 

This also makes sense. 
If a greeting card company pays a writer to create poems 
to be printed on its greeding cards, 
then the company should own the copyrights to the poems, 
unless the writer and the company have agreed otherwise in a signed writing.

In Hollywood, 
studios hire writers to create screenplays, 
with all parties knowing full well 
that the studios will own the rights. 
Writers are hired and fired 
until the script is just right. 
Yes, I am oversimplifying. 
The copyright statute's definition of a "work made for hire" is more elaborate, 
but for now assume that writers 
(using our working definition), 
especially paid screenwriters, 
create works made for hire, 
or works owned by somebody else.

## Who Owns The Rights?

Such are the perogatives of copyright OWNERSHIP. 
Authors like Amy OWN and KEEP the rights to their creations.
The author's agents and lawyers then sell or license those rights to others.

Writers are paid to create works, 
but their employers end up owning the copyright. 

## Why Register the Copyright?

### The Book Business

Ask someone in the publishing industry 
if you should copyright your manuscript 
before submitting it to agents and publishers, 
and they'll say, 
"Why? The publisher will copyright the book for you."

This is true, and nobody seems too worried 
that the author's precious words might be stolen 
before the book is published
(and the copyright is registered in the author's name). 
If the book never finds a publisher, 
then it's probably not worth stealing. 

Publishing professionals review manuscripts for a living. 
The idea that some unscrupulous idiot in the publishing industry 
would "pirate" the manuscrpt of a first novel, 
or "steal the idea" and write their own novel 
based upon a promising premise seems most unlikely. 

Would-be authors are lucky if anybody will read, 
let alone steal, their manuscripts. 
And in the case of the "high concept" thriller? 
(You don't understand, this isn't just zombies, 
it's *alien* zombies, with chainsaws for hands!) 
The fear is that the idea will be stolen, 
and it never fails to remind me 
of computing pioneer Howard Aiken's taunt to industry noobs: 

> Don't worry about people stealing your idea. 
> If your idea is any good 
> you'll have to ram it down their throats. 

Industry insiders slipping Hollywood studios 
advance looks at hot manuscripts by John Grisham or Stephen King 
might be a problem, but most would consider 
an unpublished first novel to be not yet worthy of copyright protection. 
If the author or his representative are the least bit concerned, 
copyrighting a manuscript is simple and costs only $35.00. 
It's easy to go ahead and do it if it makes an anxious author sleep easier.

Lawyer and programmer, [Ken Liu](http://kenliu.name/), has a great explanation at the Science Fiction and Fantasty Writers of America site.

> Do I have to register to get copyright protection?

> You do not. There was a time when registration made a difference in whether a work was protected by US copyright, but current law is explicit that ["registration is not a condition of copyright protection."](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408). 

Copyright attaches as soon as "original works of authorship" are ["fixed in any tangible medium of expression.](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102). In other words, your words are copyrighted as soon as you write them down, whether they’re in a notebook, a Microsoft Word file, a blog post, a forum posting, or even a Facebook comment. Registration has nothing to do with it.

Many additional protections come with registration, but probably most important are the possibility of obtaining statutory damages and attorneys fees instead of having to prove actual damages:

> Normally, when someone infringes your copyright, you’re entitled only to “actual damages” and “profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement” [17 USC §504(b)](
http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504). This can be a burden that makes pursuing a legal remedy not worthwhile: How do you prove the profits that some random web site made from publishing your story without permission? And how do you prove what sales you might have lost because of the web site’s unauthorized publication of your story? Since the US operates under the “American Rule” where each party pays their own lawyers, you might not even be able to afford to pay a lawyer to stop the infringing activity.

> But with timely registration, you get the option of electing statutory damages instead. [17 USC §504(c)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504). This can be between $750 to $30,000 per work (and up to $150,000 per work if the infringement was willful). Plus, you may get attorney’s fees and costs at the court’s discretion, making it more likely that you can retain a lawyer on a contingency fee basis. [17 USC §505](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#505). With these benefits, it may well make sense to pursue cases that otherwise you would not.
