## Copyright Ownership

Who owns the rights?

#### § 201 . Ownership of copyright

**(a) Initial Ownership.** --- 
Copyright in a work protected under this title 
vests initially in the author or authors of the work. 
The authors of a joint work are coowners of copyright in the work.

**(b) Works Made for Hire.** --- 
In the case of a work made for hire, 
the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared 
is considered the author for purposes of this title, 
and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise 
in a written instrument signed by them, 
owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.

[Copyright Act § 201][201]

## Joint Authorship 

The Copyright Act defines a "joint work" as:

> a work prepared by two or more authors 
> with the intention that their contributions 
> be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts 
> of a unitary whole.

To be considered joint authors, each author must:

1. Contribute *copyrightable* elements to the joint work, and
2. At the time the work was created, intend to merge their own contributions with the contributions of coauthors to form a unified whole. 

These rules govern WHO OWNS THE COPYRIGHT at the outset. 
As always, the parties are free to adjust ownership 
by making deals for partial ownership of the copyright. 

> [T]he person with noncopyrightable material 
> who proposes to join forces with a skilled writer
> to produce a copyrightable work 
> is free to make a contract to disclose his or her material 
> in return for assignment of part ownership of the resulting copyright.

###### United States Court of Appeals For The Second Circuit (1991)

#### Case summary

Clarice Taylor, an actress, 
wanted to develop a play about the life of ["Moms" Mabley,][mabley] 
an African-American vaudeville comedienne.
 
Taylor began to collect material about “Moms” Mabley, 
interviewing Mabley's friends and family, 
collecting her jokes, and reviewing library resources. 

In 1985, 
Taylor contacted Alice Childress, 
a professional playwright 
who had won an [“Obie” award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obie_Award) for her work 
and whose plays Taylor had acted in since the 1940s. 
Taylor wanted to hire Childress to write the play about "Moms," 
and Childress eventually agreed. 

Taylor turned over all of her research material to Childress, 
and later did further research at Childress's request. 
Taylor also paid Childress $2,500 as a down payment of sorts. 

Taylor does NOT dispute that Childress wrote the play entitled 
"Moms: A Praise Play for a Black Comedienne." 
Taylor argues however that she provided more that mere research to the project:

* Taylor sifted facts and helped select key pivotal elements to include in the play about Moms.
* Taylor also discussed general scenes and characters with Childress and whether they should be included in the play. 
* Childress and Taylor spoke on a regular basis about the progress of the play.

Childress registered copyright in the play, and the two eventually had a falling out.

The question became: **Who owned the copyright in the work?** Childress alone? Or, as Taylor argued, Childress and Taylor jointly? 

The court rejected Taylor's claim of joint authorship 
holding that a work qualifies as a “joint work” 
under the definition section of the Copyright Act, [17 U.S.C. § 101][101]
only when:

> both authors intended, 
> at the time the work was created, 
> "that their contributions be merged into inseparable 
> or interdependent parts of a unitary whole," 
> (quoting the Copyright Act)

And there was not enough evidence 
that Childress had such an intent at the time she wrote "Moms." 

The Court said that copyright law requires that 
**the contributions of both authors to be independently copyrightable**, 
and that Taylor's contributions, 
which consisted of ideas and research, 
were NOT copyrightable. 

Also no evidence suggested 
that Taylor's role ever evolved beyond helpful advice,
the same kind of advice that might come from the cast, 
the directors, or the producers of any play. 

Writing for the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Judge Jon O. Newman put it this way:

> A playwright does not so easily acquire a co-author.

#### Excerpts From *Childress* opinion 

In common with many issues 
arising in the domain of copyrights, 
the determination of whether to recognize joint authorship 
in a particular case 
requires a sensitive accommodation 
of competing demands 
advanced by at least two persons, 
both of whom have normally contributed in some way
to the creation of a work of value. 
Care must be taken 
to ensure that true collaborators in the creative process 
are accorded the perquisites of co-authorship 
and to guard against the risk 
that a sole author is denied exclusive authorship status 
simply because another person rendered some form of assistance. 
Copyright law best serves the interests of creativity 
when it carefully draws the bounds of "joint authorship" 
so as to protect the legitimate claims 
of both sole authors and coauthors.&hellip; 

[T]he prevailing view strikes an appropriate balance 
in the domains of both copyright and contract law. 
In the absence of contract, 
the copyright remains with the one or more persons 
who created copyrightable material. 
Contract law enables a person 
to hire another to create a copyrightable work, 
and the copyright law 
will recognize the employer as "author." [§ 201(b)][201]. 
Similarly, the person with non-copyrightable material 
who proposes to join forces with a skilled writer 
to produce a copyrightable work 
is free to make a contract to disclose his or her material 
in return for assignment of part ownership of the resulting copyright. [§ 201(d)][201]. 
And, as with all contract matters, 
the parties may minimize subsequent disputes 
by formalizing their agreement in a written contract. [§ 101][101] 
("work made for hire" 
definition of "specially ordered" or "commissioned" work 
includes requirement of written agreement). 
It seems more consistent 
with the spirit of copyright law 
to oblige all joint authors 
to make copyrightable contributions, 
leaving those with non-copyrightable contributions 
to protect their rights through contract.

There remains for consideration 
the crucial aspect of joint authorship---
the nature of the intent 
that must be entertained 
by each putative joint author 
at the time the contribution of each was created. 
The wording of the statutory definition 
appears to make relevant only the state of mind
regarding the unitary nature of the finished work---
an intention "that their contributions 
be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts
of a unitary whole." 
However, an inquiry so limited 
would extend joint author status 
to many persons who are not likely 
to have been within the contemplation of Congress. 
For example, 
a writer frequently works with an editor 
who makes numerous useful revisions to the first draft, 
some of which will consist of additions of copyrightable expression. 
Both intend their contributions 
to be merged into inseparable parts of a unitary whole, 
yet very few editors and even fewer writers 
would expect the editor to be accorded the status of joint author, 
enjoying an undivided half interest in the copyright 
in the published work.
Similarly, research assistants 
may on occasion contribute to an author
some protectable expression 
or merely a sufficiently original selection
of factual material 
as would be entitled to a copyright, 
yet not be entitled to be regarded as a joint author of the work 
in which the contributed material appears. 
What distinguishes the writer-editor relationship 
and the writer-researcher relationship 
from the true joint author relationship 
is the lack of intent of both participants in the
venture to regard themselves as joint authors.&hellip; 

Examination of whether the putative co-authors 
ever shared an intent to be co-authors 
serves the valuable purpose of appropriately confining the
bounds of joint authorship arising by operation of copyright law, 
while leaving those not in a true joint authorship relationship 
with an author free to bargain for an arrangement 
that will be recognized as a matter of both copyright and contract law. 
Joint authorship entitles the co-authors 
to equal undivided interests in the work, *see* [§ 201(a)][201] &hellip; 
That equal sharing of rights 
should be reserved for relationships 
in which all participants fully intend to be joint authors. 
The sharing of benefits in other relationships 
involving assistance in the creation of a copyrightable work 
can be more precisely calibrated 
by the participants in their contract negotiations 
regarding division of royalties 
or assignment of shares of ownership of the copyright, *see*
[§ 201(d)][201].&hellip; 

There is no evidence that Childress ever contemplated, 
much less would have accepted, 
crediting the play as 
"written by Alice Childress and Clarice Taylor."

Childress was asked to write a play about "Moms" Mabley and did so. 
To facilitate her writing task, 
she accepted the assistance that Taylor provided, 
which consisted largely of furnishing the results of research
concerning the life of "Moms" Mabley. 
As the actress expected to portray the leading role, 
Taylor also made some incidental suggestions,
contributing ideas about the presentation of the play's subject 
and possibly some minor bits of expression. 
But there is no evidence 
that these aspects of Taylor's role 
ever evolved into more than the helpful advice 
that might come from the cast, 
the directors, or the producers of any play. 
A playwright does not so easily acquire a co-author.

#### Commentary on *Childress*

* Leslie J. Lott, Esq., [*When does an Editor’s input create a Joint Work of Authorship?*][leslie]

## Works Made For Hire

So far, so good. 
If the author creates the work, 
the author owns the copyright. 
If the author creates the work *with* somebody else, 
and they created a [joint work][201], 
then they are both authors and coowners of copyright in the work. 

But what about hired guns? 
What happens if somebody else pays the author to create the work? 
Shouldn't the person who hired the author 
own the copyright in the work? Yes.

The copyright statute calls this 
a "work made for hire," 
and says that ["the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared"][201] is considered the author of the copyrighted work. 

For example, 
if the studio hires the screenwriter to create a screenplay, 
the studio owns the copyright to the screenplay, 
which is why writers are hired and fired 
until the script is just right. 
Yes, I am oversimplifying. 
The copyright statute's definition of a "work made for hire" 
is more elaborate, 
but Hollywood screenwriters, especially *hired* screenwriters, 
create works made for hire, or works owned by somebody else.

Under [§ 101][101] of the Copyright Act, a “work made for hire” is— 

1. a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or

2. a work specially ordered or commissioned for use 
    - as a contribution to a collective work, 
    - as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, 
    - as a translation, 
    - as a supplementary work, 
    - as a compilation, 
    - as an instructional text, 
    - as a test, 
    - as answer material for a test, 
    - or as an atlas,
    - **if** the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.&hellip; 

In the next case, the United States Supreme Court applies these straightforward provisions to a messy set of facts. 

In the words of Francois La Rochefoucauld:

> There is nothing more horrible than the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of brutal facts.

This case is an important United States Supreme Court case decided on its facts and on a careful reading of the work for hire provisions of the Copyright Act. It has major implications in many areas of the law (contract, employment, intellectual property, torts), because it addresses the crucial status of an artist as either empolyee or independent contractor. 

## Licensing

Courts must often apply old contract language to new technologies. 

Suppose an author licenses a publisher to print her books in hardcover or paperback. Does that license also include the right to publish the same book as an e-book? What if e-book technology did not exist when the author made the original publishing deal?

What happens when a person with a license to exhibit a movie on television now wants to exhibit a movie using VCR tapes or DVD discs? What if these technologies didn't even exist when the artist made his deal with the studio? 

That's the story of *Cohen v. Paramount.*

HUG, Circuit Judge:

This case involves a novel issue of copyright law: 
whether a license conferring the right to exhibit a film 
"by means of television" includes
the right to distribute videocassettes of the film. 
We hold it does not.

#### FACTS

Herbert Cohen is the owner of the copyright in a musical composition
entitled "Merry-Go-Round" (hereinafter "the composition"). On May 12,
1969, Cohen granted H & J Pictures, Inc., a "synchronization" license,
which gave H & J the right to use the composition in a film called
"Medium Cool" and to exhibit the film in theatres and on
television. Subsequently, H & J assigned to Paramount
Pictures all of its rights, title, and interest in the movie "Medium
Cool," including all of the rights and interests created by the 1969
license from Cohen to H & J. Sometime later, Paramount furnished a
negative of the film to a videocassette manufacturer, who made copies of
the film — including a recording of the composition — and supplied these
copies to Paramount. Paramount, in turn, sold approximately 2,725
videocassettes of the film, receiving a gross revenue of $69,024.26
from the sales.

On February 20, 1985, Cohen filed suit against Paramount in federal
district court alleging copyright infringement. Cohen contended that the
license granted to H & J did not confer the right to use the composition
in a reproduction of the film in videocassettes distributed for home
display. The parties stipulated to the facts and both filed motions for
summary judgment. The district court entered judgment in favor of
Paramount, and Cohen appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1291 (1982).

#### DISCUSSION

[ &hellip; ]

To resolve this case, we must examine the terms of the license, in order
to determine whether the license conveyed the right to use the
composition in making and distributing videocassette reproductions of
"Medium Cool." The document begins by granting the licensee the
"authority &hellip; to record, in any manner, medium, form or language, the
words and music of the musical composition &hellip; with ['Medium Cool']...
to make copies of such recordings and to perform said musical
composition everywhere, *all in accordance* with the terms, conditions,
and limitations hereinafter set forth.&hellip;" (Emphasis added.) 

Paragraph 4 states:

> The &hellip; license herein granted to perform &hellip; said musical
composition is granted for: (a) The exhibition of said motion picture
&hellip; to audiences in motion picture theatres and other places of public
entertainment where motion pictures are customarily exhibited &hellip; (b)
The exhibition of said motion picture &hellip; *by means of television* &hellip; 
including 'pay television', 'subscription television' and 'closed
circuit into homes' television.&hellip; " (Emphasis added.) 

Finally, paragraph 6 of the license reserves to the grantor:

> all rights and uses in and to said musical composition, except those herein granted to the
Licensee.&hellip;" 

Although the language of the license permits the
*recording and copying* of the movie with the musical composition in it,
in any manner, medium, or form, 
nothing in the express language of the license 
authorizes *distribution* of the copies to the public 
by sale or rental.

One of the separate rights of copyright, 
as enumerated in [section 106][106] of the Copyright Act, is the right:

> to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work 
> to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, 
> or by rental, lease, or lending.

[17 U.S.C. § 106(3)][106]. 

Thus, the right to distribute copies of the videocassettes by sale or rental
remained with the grantor under the reservation of rights provision in
paragraph 6, unless in some way it is encompassed within the right to
*perform* the work.

The limitation on the right to perform the synchronization with the
composition in it is found in paragraph 4 and that paragraph limits the
right to perform, or to authorize others to perform, to: 

> 4(a) exhibition of the motion picture to audiences in motion picture theatres and other places of public entertainment where motion pictures are customarily shown, and 

> 4(b) exhibition of the motion picture by means of television, including pay television, subscription television, and "closed circuit into homes" television.

It is obvious 
that the distribution of videocassettes 
through sale and rental to the general public 
for viewing in their homes 
does not fit within the purpose of category 4(a) above, 
which is restricted to showing in theatres 
and other similar public places. 
Paramount argues that it fits within 4(b), 
in that the distribution of videocassettes 
for showing in private homes is the equivalent of 
"exhibition by means of television." 
Paragraph 4(b) grants to Paramount 
the limited right to authorize broadcasters 
and cable television companies 
to broadcast the movie over the airwaves 
or to transmit it by cable, microwave, 
or some such means from a central location. 
The words of that paragraph must be tortured 
to expand the limited right granted by that section 
to an entirely different means of making that film available 
to the general public---the distribution of individual videocassettes 
to the general public for private "performances" in their homes. 
The general tenor of the section 
contemplates some sort of broadcasting 
or centralized distribution, 
not distribution by sale or rental 
of individual copies to the general public. 
Furthermore, the exhibition of the videocassette 
in the home is not "by means of television." 
Though videocassettes may be exhibited by using a television monitor, 
it does not follow that, for copyright purposes, 
playing videocassettes constitutes 
"exhibition by television." 
Exhibition of a film on television differs fundamentally
from exhibition by means of a videocassette recorder ("VCR"). 
Television requires an intermediary network, 
station, or cable to send the television signals into consumers' homes. 
The menu of entertainment appearing on television
is controlled entirely by the intermediary 
and, thus, the consumer's selection is limited 
to what is available on various channels. 
Moreover, equipped merely with a conventional television set, 
a consumer has no means of capturing any part of the television display; 
when the program is over it vanishes, 
and the consumer is powerless to replay it. 
Because they originate outside the home, 
television signals are ephemeral 
and beyond the viewer's grasp.

Videocassettes, of course, allow viewing of a markedly different nature.
Videocassette entertainment is controlled within the home, at the
viewer's complete discretion. A consumer may view exactly what he or she
wants (assuming availability in the marketplace) at whatever time he or
she chooses. The viewer may even "fast forward" the tape so as to
quickly pass over parts of the program he or she does not wish to view.
By their very essence, then, videocassettes liberate viewers from the
constraints otherwise inherent in television, and eliminate the
involvement of an intermediary, such as a network.

Television and videocassette display thus have very little in common
besides the fact that a conventional monitor of a television set may be
used both to receive television signals and to exhibit a videocassette.
It is in light of this fact that Paramount argues that VCRs are
equivalent to "exhibition by means of television." Yet, even that
assertion is flawed. Playing a videocassette on a VCR does not require a
standard television set capable of receiving television signals by cable
or by broadcast; it is only necessary to have a monitor capable of
displaying the material on the magnetized tape.

Perhaps the primary reason why the words "exhibition by means of
television" in the license cannot be construed as including the
distribution of videocassettes for home viewing is that VCRs for home
use were not invented or known in 1969, when the license was executed.
The parties both acknowledge this fact and it is noted in the order of
the district judge. Thus, in 1969 — long before the market for
videocassettes burgeoned — Cohen could not have assumed that the public
would have free and virtually unlimited access to the film in which the
composition was played; instead, he must have assumed that viewer access
to the film "Medium Cool" would be largely controlled by theatres and
networks. By the same token, the original licensee could not have
bargained for, or paid for, the rights associated with videocassette
reproduction. The holder of the
license should not now "reap the entire windfall" associated with the
new medium. As noted above, the license reserved to the
grantor "all rights and uses in and to said musical composition, except
those herein granted to the licensee...." This language operates to
preclude uses not then known to, or contemplated by the parties. Thus,
by its terms, the contract did not convey the right to reproduce and
distribute videocassettes. That right, having not been granted to the
licensee, was among those that were reserved.

Moreover, the license must be construed in accordance with the purpose
underlying federal copyright law. Courts have repeatedly stated that the
Copyright Act was "intended definitively to grant valuable, enforceable
rights to authors, publishers, etc.&hellip; 'to afford greater
encouragement to the production of literary works of lasting benefit to
the world.'" [*Washington Publishing Co. v. Pearson,* (1939)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14367358885827043326);
[*Scott v. WKJG, Inc.,* (7th Cir. 1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14403650087245144029)
("A copyright is intended to protect authorship. The essence of a
copyright protection is the protection of originality rather than
novelty or invention.") [*Jondora Music Publishing Co. v. Melody
Recordings, Inc.,* (3d Cir.)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8369246767446993883) (as amended), *cert. denied,* [(1975)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=5377176924235163259)
("The copyright law is enacted for the benefit of the composer...."). We
would frustrate the purposes of the Act were we to construe this license
— with its limiting language — as granting a right in a medium that had
not been introduced to the domestic market at the time the parties
entered into the agreement.

Paramount directs our
attention to two district court cases, which, it contends, compel the
opposite result. Both, however, involve licenses that contain language
markedly different from the language in the license at hand.

[*Platinum Record Company, Inc. v. Lucasfilm, Ltd.,* (D.N.J.1983),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11097878598725181240)
involved an agreement executed in 1973 in which plaintiff's predecessor
in interest granted Lucasfilm, a film producer, the right to use four
popular songs on the soundtrack of the motion picture *American
Graffiti.* The agreement expressly conferred the right to 

> exhibit, 
distribute, exploit, market and perform said motion picture, its air,
screen and television trailers, perpetually throughout the world *by any
means or methods now or hereafter known.* (emphasis
added). 

Lucasfilm produced *American Graffiti* under a contract with
Universal. The film was shown in theatres and on cable, network,
and local television. In 1980, a Universal affiliate released the film
for sale and rental to the public on videocassettes. Plaintiffs
brought suit against Universal and its affiliate, alleging that the
agreement did not give them the right to distribute the film on
videocassettes.

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. It reasoned that the language in the agreement conferring
the right to exhibit the film" 'by any means or methods now or
hereafter known'" was "extremely broad and completely unambiguous, and
precludes any need in the Agreement for an exhaustive list of specific
potential uses of the film.&hellip;  It is obvious that the contract in
question may 'fairly be read' as including newly developed media, and
the absence of any specific mention in the Agreement of videotapes and
video cassettes is thus insignificant." 

Similarly, the district court in [*Rooney v. Columbia Pictures
Industries, Inc.,* (S.D.N.Y.1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12025221074690857236) *aff'd,* [(2d Cir.1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=6254988141750946468)
*cert. denied,* [(1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=1764013068463333018)
found that the contracts in question, which granted rights to exhibit
certain films, also gave defendants the right to sell videocassettes of
the films. Like the contract in *Platinum,* the contracts
in *Rooney* contained sweeping language, granting, for example, the
right to exhibit the films 

> by any present or *future* methods or means, and by any other means *now known or unknown.*"
(emphasis added). 

The court stated, "The contracts in question gave
defendants extremely broad rights in the distribution and exhibition of
[the films], plainly intending that such rights would be without
limitation unless otherwise specified and further indicating that future
technological advances in methods of reproduction, transmission, and
exhibition would inure to the benefit of defendants."

In contrast to the contracts in *Platinum* and *Rooney,* the license in
this case lacks such broad language. The contracts in those cases
expressly conferred the right to exhibit the films by methods yet to be
invented. Not only is this language missing in the license at hand, but
the license also expressly reserves to the copyright holder all rights
not expressly granted. We fail to find the *Rooney* and *Platinum*
decisions persuasive.

#### CONCLUSION

We hold that the license did not give Paramount the right to use the
composition in connection with videocassette production and distribution
of the film "Medium Cool." The district court's award of summary
judgment in favor of Paramount is reversed.

REVERSED and REMANDED.

#### Notes on *Cohen v. Paramount Pictures Corp.*

In 1969, Herbert Cohen owned copyright in a song called “Merry-Go-Round.” 
Cohen granted a “synchronization” license 
which gave Paramount the right to use the song "Merry-Go-Round" in a film called *Medium Cool.* 

The license also gave Paramount the right to exhibit the movie 
"by means of television, including pay television, 
subscription television, and closed circuit into homes television." 

Over a decade later, in the 1980s, 
Paramount made the film *Medium Cool* available on videocassettes 
and sold around 3,000 copies, receiving gross revenue of $70,000 or so. 

Cohen sued for copyright violation and won. 

A license conferring the right to exhibit a film "by means of television" 
DOES NOT include the right to distribute videocassettes of the film.

The license Cohen granted held back:

> all rights and uses in and to said musical composition, 
> except those herein granted to the licensee . . .

The court found that this language 
limited uses to those known or contemplated by the parties. 

When Cohen signed the deal in 1969, 
videocassette recorders (VCRs) had not been invented yet, 
so Cohen could not have known 
he was selling the right to display a movie using his song on videocassette.

Paramount argued that the terms of Cohen's license 
were similar to agreements in two other early videocassette cases,
in which an original grant of rights included videocassette rights, even though such rights did not exist at the time of the original deal. 

1. A contract between *Platinum Record Co. v. LucasFilm* (DCNJ 1983) giving the right: "to exhibit, distribute, exploit, market and perform said motion picture, its air, screen and television trailers, **perpetually throughout the world by any means or methods now or hereafter known.**"
2. A contract in *Rooney v. Columbia Pictures* (SDNY 1982) which licensed the right to exhibit the films: **by any present or future methods or means** and by **any other means now known or unknown**.
 
The court ruled that these two licenses indeed 
included the right to make the work available on videocassette, 
but only because the terms used 
were far broader and more inclusive 
than than the language in Cohen's deal:

> all rights and uses in and to said musical composition, 
> except those herein granted to the licensee . . .

And the court noted that Cohen had expressly reserved any rights not transferred.

### *Effects Associates v. Cohen* 

###### United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (1990)

Low-budget horror movie mogul Larry Cohen made a movie 
called *The Stuff* 
about a yogurt-like alien life form invading earth. 

Cohen hired Effects Associates to make some special effects for the movie, 
including video showing the climactic explosion of a factory 
where The Stuff was mass-produced. 

Cohen orally promised to pay Effects Associates $64,000 
for creating the special effects. 

No written agreement and no discussion 
about who would own the copyright to the special effects footage. 

Effects Associates delivered the special effects as promised, 
but Cohen was unhappy about the factory explosion, 
and so paid only half of the promised amount for that sequence, 
for a total of $56,000. 

Effects Associates made several demands 
for the rest of the agreed sum (a little over $8,000), 
but Cohen refused to pay. 

Cohen went ahead and used the footage 
(including the factory explosion sequence) in the film, 
and turned *The Stuff* over to New World Entertainment for distribution.
 
Effects Associates sued for copyright infringement, 
claiming that Cohen (along with his production company and New World) 
had no right to use the special effects footage 
unless Cohen paid Effects Associates the full contract price. 

The court ruled that Effects Associates 
had not transfered copyright in the special effects footage 
because transfers of copyright must be **IN WRITING.** 
Cohen argued that regardless of what the Copyright Act says, 
the industry standard in the movie business 
was to have oral agreements. 

Moviemakers do lunch, not contracts, Cohen argued. 
Moviemakers are too absorbed in developing “joint creative endeavors” 
to “focus upon the legal niceties of copyright licenses." 
The Court disagreed with this notion, 
but noted that **nonexclusive licenses** need not be in writing 
and may be implied by the behavior of the parties. 
The Court found that since Effects made the footage to Cohen's specifications 
and gave it to him, 
there was an implied license for Cohen to use it.

The court called copyright ownership "a bundle of rights":

> In granting a nonexclusive license to Cohen, 
> Effects has given up only one stick from that bundle---the 
> right to sue Cohen for copyright infringement. 
> It retains the right to sue him in state court 
> on a variety of other grounds, 
> including breach of contract. 
> Additionally, Effects may license, sell or give away for nothing 
> its remaining rights in the special effects footage.

## Digital Sampling and Imaging

[Circular 56a][circ56a], 
published by the United States Copyright Office, 
and entitled 
"Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings" 
explains the difference, for copyright purposes, 
between musical compositions and sound recordings.

**A musical composition:** consists of music, 
including any accompanying words, 
and is normally registered as a work of the performing arts. 
The author of a musical composition is generally the composer, 
and the lyricist, if any.
A musical composition may be in the form of a notated copy 
(for example, sheet music) 
or in the form of a phonorecord 
(for example, cassette tape, LP, or CD). 
Sending a musical composition in the form of a phonorecord 
does not necessarily mean 
that there is a claim to copyright in the sound recording.

**A sound recording:** results from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken or other sounds. 
The author of a sound recording 
is the performer(s) whose performance is fixed, 
or the record producer who processes the sounds 
and fixes them in the final recording, or both. 
Copyright in a sound recording is not the same as, 
or a substitute for, 
copyright in the underlying musical composition.

### *Newton v. Diamond*

###### United States Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit (2003)

* [case on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7229536370368292204)

Opinion by Chief Judge SCHROEDER. Dissent by Judge GRABER.

SCHROEDER, Chief Judge:

This appeal raises the difficult and important issue of whether 
the incorporation of a short segment of a musical recording 
into a new musical recording, i.e., 
the practice of "sampling," 
requires a license 
to use both the performance 
and the composition of the original recording. 
The particular sample in this case 
consists of a six-second, three-note segment of a performance 
of one of his own compositions by plaintiff, 
and accomplished jazz flutist, James W. Newton. 

The defendants, the performers who did the sampling, 
are the members of the musical group Beastie Boys. 
They obtained a license 
to sample the sound recording of Newton's copyrighted performance, 
but they did not obtain a license to use Newton's underlying composition, 
which is also copyrighted.

#### Background and Procedural History

The plaintiff and appellant in this case, James W. Newton, 
is an accomplished avant-garde jazz flutist and composer. 
In 1978, he composed the song "Choir" &hellip; 
Newton performed and recorded "Choir" 
and licensed all rights in the sound recording to ECM Records for $5000. 
The license covered only the sound recording, 
and it is undisputed that Newton retained all rights 
to the composition of "Choir." 
Sound recordings and their underlying compositions are separate works 
with their own distinct copyrights. [17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(2), (7)][102].

The defendants and appellees include the members of the rap and hip-hop
group Beastie Boys, and their business associates. In 1992, Beastie Boys
obtained a license from ECM Records to use portions of the sound
recording of "Choir" in various renditions of their song "Pass the Mic"
in exchange for a one-time fee of $1000. Beastie Boys did
not obtain a license from Newton to use the underlying composition.

The portion of the composition at issue consists of three notes, C — D
flat — C, sung over a background C note played on the flute. When played
on the sound recording licensed by Beastie Boys, the segment lasts for
approximately six seconds. The score to "Choir" also indicates that the
entire song should be played in a "largo/senza-misura" tempo, meaning
"slowly/without-measure." Apart from an instruction that the performer
sing into the flute and finger simultaneously, the score is not further
orchestrated.&hellip; 

Pursuant to their license from ECM Records, Beastie Boys digitally
sampled the opening six seconds of Newton's sound recording of "Choir."
Beastie Boys repeated or "looped" this six-second sample as a background
element throughout "Pass the Mic," so that it appears over forty times
in various renditions of the song. In addition to the version of "Pass
the Mic" released on their 1992 album, "Check Your Head," Beastie Boys
included the "Choir" sample in two remixes, "Dub the Mic" and "Pass the
Mic (Pt. 2, Skills to Pay the Bills)." It is unclear whether the sample was altered or
manipulated, though Beastie Boys' sound engineer stated that alterations
of tone, pitch, and rhythm are commonplace, and Newton maintains that
the pitch was lowered slightly.&hellip; 

#### Whether Defendants' Use was De Minimis

Assuming that the sampled segment of the composition 
was sufficiently original to merit copyright protection, 
we nevertheless affirm on the ground 
that Beastie Boys' use was de minimis 
and therefore not actionable.

For an unauthorized use of a copyrighted work to be actionable, 
there must be substantial similarity 
between the plaintiff's and the defendants' works.
This means that even where the fact of copying is conceded, 
no legal consequences will follow from that fact 
unless the copying is substantial. 
The principle that trivial copying does not constitute
actionable infringement has long been a part of copyright law. 
Indeed, as Judge Learned Hand observed over 80 years ago: 

> Even where there is some copying, 
> that fact is not conclusive of infringement. 
> Some copying is permitted. 
> In addition to copying, 
> it must be shown that this has been done to an unfair extent.

[*West Publ'g Co. v. Edward Thompson Co.,* (E.D.N.Y.1909)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=16045528342371426574).

This principle reflects the legal maxim, *de minimis non curat lex*
(often rendered as, "the law does not concern itself with trifles").

The leading case on de minimis infringement 
in our circuit is [*Fisher v. Dees,* (9th Cir.1986),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16874877052780018691)
where we observed that a use is de minimis 
only if the average audience 
would not recognize the appropriation.&hellip; 
("[A] taking is considered de minimis 
only if it is so meager and fragmentary that
the average audience would not recognize the appropriation."). 
This observation reflects the relationship 
between the de minimis maxim 
and the general test for substantial similarity, 
which also looks to the response of the average audience, 
or ordinary observer, to determine whether a use is infringing. 
To say that a use is de minimis 
because no audience would recognize the appropriation 
is thus to say that the works are not substantially similar.&hellip; 

This case involves not only use of a composition, 
as was the case in *Fisher,* 
but also use of a sound recording 
of a performance of that composition. 
Because the defendants licensed the sound recording, 
our inquiry is confined to whether 
the unauthorized use of the composition itself 
was substantial enough to sustain an infringement claim.
Therefore, we may consider only Beastie Boys' appropriation 
of the song's compositional elements 
and must remove from consideration 
all the elements unique to Newton's performance. 
Stated another way, 
we must "filter out" the licensed elements 
of the sound recording 
to get down to the unlicensed elements of the composition, 
as the composition is the sole basis for Newton's infringement claim. 

In filtering out the unique performance elements from consideration, 
and separating them from those found in the composition, 
we find substantial assistance 
in the testimony of Newton's own experts. 
His experts reveal the extent to which 
the sound recording of "Choir" 
is the product of Newton's highly developed performance techniques, 
rather than the result of a generic rendition of the composition. 
As a general matter, 
according to Newton's expert Dr. Christopher Dobrian, 
"the contribution of the performer is often so great 
that s/he in fact provides as much musical content as the composer." 
This is particularly true with works like "Choir," 
given the nature of jazz performance and
the minimal scoring of the composition &hellip;

Whatever copyright interest Newton obtained 
in this "dense cluster of pitches and ambient sounds," 
he licensed that interest to ECM Records over twenty years ago, 
and ECM Records in turn licensed that interest to Beastie Boys. 
Thus, regardless of whether the average audience 
might recognize "the Newton technique" 
at work in the sampled sound recording,
those performance elements are beyond consideration 
in Newton's claim for infringement of his copyright 
in the underlying composition. 
Having licensed away his interest in the recording of his performance, Newton's only claim is for a violation of his rights 
in the three-note sequence transcribed in the composition.

Once we have isolated the basis of Newton's infringement action---
the "Choir" composition, 
devoid of the unique performance elements 
found only in the sound recording---
we turn to the nub of our inquiry: 
whether Beastie Boys' unauthorized use of the composition, 
as opposed to their authorized use of the sound recording, 
was substantial enough to sustain an infringement action. 
In answering that question, 
we must distinguish 
between the degree and the substantiality of the works' similarity. 
The practice of music sampling will often present cases 
where the degree of similarity is high. 
Indeed, unless the sample has been altered or digitally manipulated, 
it will be identical to the original. 
Yet as Nimmer explains, 
"[if] the similarity is only as to nonessential matters, 
then a finding of no substantial similarity should result." &hellip; 
This reflects the principle 
that the substantiality requirement 
applies throughout the law of copyright, 
including cases of music sampling, 
even where there is a high degree of similarity.&hellip;"

When viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, 
the sampled portion 
is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant.
Quantitatively, the three-note sequence 
appears only once in Newton's composition. 
It is difficult to measure the precise relationship between
this segment and the composition as a whole, 
because the score 
calls for between 180 and 270 seconds of improvisation. 
When played, however, the segment lasts six seconds 
and is roughly two percent 
of the four-and-a-half-minute "Choir" sound recording 
licensed by Beastie Boys.
Qualitatively, this section of the composition 
is no more significant than any other section. 
Indeed, with the exception of two notes, 
the entirety of the scored portions of "Choir" 
consist of notes separated by
whole and half-steps from their neighbors; 
the remainder of the composition calls for sections of improvisation 
that range between 90 and 180 seconds in length. 
Although the sampled section 
may be representative of the scored portions of the composition, 
Newton has failed to offer any evidence 
as to this section's particular significance 
in the composition as a whole. 
Instead, his experts emphasize the significance 
of Newton's performance, the unique elements
of which Beastie Boys properly licensed.

Yet Newton maintains that the testimony of his experts creates a genuine
issue of material fact on the substantiality of the copying. To the
extent the expert testimony is relevant, it is not helpful to Newton. On
the key question of whether the sample is quantitatively or
qualitatively significant in relation to the composition as a whole, his
experts are either silent or fail to distinguish between the sound
recording, which was licensed, and the composition, which was not.
Moreover, their testimony on the composition does not contain anything
from which a reasonable jury could infer the segment's significance in
relation to the composition as a whole: rather, Dr. Dobrian described
the three-note sequence at issue as "a simple 'neighboring tone'
figure." The district court cited two pieces by Gyorgy Ligeti and Jacob
Druckman employing similar figures. [*Newton*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4721801243812962515).
This evidence is consistent with the opinion of Beastie Boys' expert,
Dr. Lawrence Ferrara, who stated that the sampled excerpt from the
"Choir" composition "is merely a common, trite, and generic three-note
sequence, which lacks any distinct melodic, harmonic, rhythmic or
structural elements." Dr. Ferrara also described the sequence as "a
common building block tool" used over and over again by major composers
in the 20th century, particularly  the '60s and '70s, just prior to James
Newton's usage.

Having failed to demonstrate any quantitative or qualitative
significance of the sample in the "Choir" composition as a whole, Newton
is in a weak position to argue that the similarities between the works
are substantial, or that an average audience would recognize the
appropriation. In this respect, the minimal scoring of the "Choir"
composition bears emphasis, as does the relative simplicity of the
relevant portion of the composition. On the undisputed facts of this
case, we conclude that an average audience would not discern Newton's
hand as a composer, apart from his talent as a performer, from Beastie
Boys' use of the sample. The works are not substantially similar:
Beastie Boys' use of the "Choir" composition was de minimis. There is no
genuine issue of material fact, and the grant of summary judgment was
appropriate.

#### Conclusion

Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the
sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright
interest in the "Choir" composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys'
use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes
separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to
sustain a claim for copyright infringement. We affirm the district
court's grant of summary judgment on the ground that Beastie Boys' use
of the composition was de minimis and therefore not actionable.

AFFIRMED.

GRABER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:

I respectfully dissent. The majority has laid out correctly the legal
principles that apply in this case, and I agree with the majority's
assumption that the sampled portion of "Choir" qualifies as "original"
and therefore is copyrightable. However, on the record
before us, a jury reasonably could find that Beastie Boys' use of the
sampled material was not de minimis. Therefore, summary judgment is
inappropriate.

As the majority observes, a use is de minimis only if an average
audience would not recognize the appropriation. [*Fisher v. Dees,* n. 2 (9th
Cir.1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16874877052780018691).
The majority is correct that James Newton's considerable skill adds many
recognizable features to the performance sampled by Beastie Boys. Even
after those features are "filtered out," however, the composition,
standing alone, is distinctive enough for a jury reasonably to conclude
that an average audience would recognize the appropriation of the
sampled segment and that Beastie Boys' use was therefore not de minimis.

Newton has presented evidence that the compositional elements of "Choir"
are so compositionally distinct that a reasonable listener would
recognize the sampled segment even if it were performed by the featured
flautist of a middle school orchestra. It is useful to begin by
observing that the majority's repeated references to the sampled segment
of "Choir" as a "3-note sequence" are overly simplified.
The sampled segment is actually a three-note sequence sung above a
fingered held C note, for a total of four separate tones.
Even passages with relatively few notes may be qualitatively
significant. The opening melody of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
relatively simple and features  only four notes, but it certainly is
compositionally distinctive and recognizable.

The majority is simply mistaken in its assertion that
Newton's experts did not present evidence of the qualitative value of
the compositional elements of the sampled material sufficient to survive
summary judgment. The majority is similarly mistaken when it says,
*id.,* that Newton's experts failed to distinguish between the sound
recording and the composition. To the contrary, Newton presented
considerable expert evidence that the composition *alone* is distinctive
and recognizable.

[Judge Graber quotes from letters sent by two professors attesting to the distinctiveness of the musical composition, and not just the sampled recording of Newton's performance.]

The majority, then, misreads the record when it states that Newton
failed to offer evidence that the sampled material is qualitatively
significant. In fact, Newton presented evidence, as described above, to
show that an average and reasonable listener would recognize Beastie
Boys' appropriation  of
the *composition* of the sampled material.

Because Newton has presented evidence establishing that reasonable ears
differ over the qualitative significance of the composition of the
sampled material, summary judgement is inappropriate in this case.
Newton should be allowed to present his claims of infringement to a
jury. I therefore dissent from the majority's conclusion to the
contrary.

####  AMENDED OPINION ON REHEARING

RALPH B. GUY, JR., Circuit Judge.

This action arises out of the use of a sample 
from the composition and sound recording 
"Get Off Your Ass and Jam" ("Get Off") 
in the rap song "100 Miles and Runnin'" ("100 Miles"), 
which was included in the sound track of the movie 
*I Got the Hook Up* (*Hook Up*).&hellip; 

Bridgeport and Westbound claim to own 
the musical composition and sound recording copyrights in 
"Get Off Your Ass and Jam" 
by George Clinton, Jr. and the Funkadelics.&hellip; 
There seems to be no dispute 
either that "Get Off" was digitally sampled 
or that the recording "100 Miles" was included 
on the sound track of *I Got the Hook Up.* 

Defendant No Limit Films, 
in conjunction with Priority Records, 
released the movie to theaters on May 27, 1998.
The movie was apparently also released on VHS, DVD, and cable
television.&hellip; 

Westbound's claims are for infringement 
of the sound recording "Get Off." 
Because defendant does not deny it, we assume that
the sound track of *Hook Up* used portions of "100 Miles" that included
the allegedly infringing sample from "Get Off." The recording "Get Off"
opens with a three-note combination solo guitar "riff" that lasts four
seconds. According to one of plaintiffs' experts, Randy Kling, the
recording "100 Miles" contains a sample from that guitar solo.
Specifically, a two-second sample from the guitar solo was copied, the
pitch was lowered, and the copied piece was "looped" and extended to 16
beats. Kling states that this sample appears in the sound recording "100
Miles" in five places; specifically, at 0:49, 1:52, 2:29, 3:20 and 3:46.
By the district court's estimation, each looped segment lasted
approximately 7 seconds. As for the segment copied from "Get Off," the
district court described it as follows:

> The portion of the song at issue here is an arpeggiated chord—that is,
> three notes that, if struck together, comprise a chord but instead are
> played one at a time in very quick succession—that is repeated several
> times at the opening of "Get Off." The arpeggiated chord is played on
> an unaccompanied electric guitar. The rapidity of the notes and the
> way they are played produce a high-pitched, whirling sound that
> captures the listener's attention and creates anticipation of what is
> to follow.

[*Bridgeport,* 230 F.Supp.2d at
839](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10196107418922785917).&hellip; 

#### Digital Sampling of Copyrighted Sound Recordings

At the outset it is important to make clear the precise nature of our
decision. Our conclusions are as follows:

1. The analysis that is appropriate for determining infringement of a
musical composition copyright, is not the analysis that is to be applied
to determine infringement of a sound recording. We address this issue
only as it pertains to sound recording copyrights.
2. Since the district court decision essentially tracked the analysis
that is made if a musical composition copyright were at issue, we depart
from that analysis.
3. We agree with the district court's analysis on the question of
originality. On remand, we assume that Westbound will be able to
establish it has a copyright in the sound recording and that a digital
sample from the copyrighted sound recording was used in this case.
4. This case involves "digital sampling" which is a term of art well
understood by the parties to this litigation and the music industry in
general. Accordingly, we adopt the definition commonly accepted within
the industry.
5. Because of the court's limited technological knowledge in this
specialized field, our opinion is limited to an instance of digital
sampling of a sound recording protected by a valid copyright. If by
analogy it is possible to extend our analysis to other forms of
sampling, we leave it to others to do so.
6. Advances in technology coupled with the advent of the
popularity of hip  hop
or rap music have made instances of digital sampling extremely common
and have spawned a plethora of copyright disputes and litigation.
7. The music industry, as well as the courts, are best served if
something approximating a bright-line test can be established. Not
necessarily a "one size fits all" test, but one that, at least, adds
clarity to what constitutes actionable infringement with regard to the
digital sampling of copyrighted sound recordings.

#### Analysis

[ &hellip; ]

Get a license or do not sample. 
We do not see this as stifling creativity in any significant way. 
It must be remembered 
that if an artist wants to incorporate a "riff" from another work in his or her recording, 
he is free to duplicate the sound of that "riff" in the studio. 
Second, the market will control the license price and keep it within bounds.
The sound recording copyright holder cannot exact a license fee greater
than what it would cost the person seeking the license to just duplicate
the sample in the course of making the new recording. Third, sampling is
never accidental. It is not like the case of a composer who has a melody
in his head, perhaps not even realizing that the reason he hears this
melody is that it is the work of another which he had heard before. When
you sample a sound recording you know you are taking another's work
product.

This analysis admittedly raises the question of why one should, without
infringing, be able to take three notes from a musical composition, for
example, but not three notes by way of sampling from a sound recording.
Why is there no *de minimis* taking or why should substantial similarity
not enter the equation. Our first answer to this question
is what we have earlier indicated. We think this result is dictated by
the applicable statute. Second, even  when a small part of a sound recording
is sampled, the part taken is something of value. No
further proof of that is necessary than the fact that the producer of
the record or the artist on the record intentionally sampled because it
would (1) save costs, or (2) add something to the new recording, or (3)
both. For the sound recording copyright holder, it is not the "song" but
the sounds that are fixed in the medium of his choice. When those sounds
are sampled they are taken directly from that fixed medium. It is a
physical taking rather than an intellectual one.

This case also illustrates the kind of mental, musicological, and
technological gymnastics that would have to be employed if one were to
adopt a *de minimis* or substantial similarity analysis. The district
judge did an excellent job of navigating these troubled waters, but not
without dint of great effort. When one considers that he has hundreds of
other cases all involving different samples from different songs, the
value of a principled bright-line rule becomes apparent. We would want
to emphasize, however, that considerations of judicial economy are not
what drives this opinion. If any consideration of economy is involved it
is that of the music industry. As this case and other companion cases
make clear, it would appear to be cheaper to license than to
litigate.&hellip; 

[T]here is no Rosetta stone for the
interpretation of the copyright statute. We have taken a "literal
reading" approach. The legislative history is of little help because
digital sampling wasn't being done in 1971. If this is not what Congress
intended or is not what they would intend now, it is easy enough for the
record industry, as they have done in the past, to go back to Congress
for a clarification or change in the law. This is the best place for the
change to be made, rather than in the courts, because as this case
demonstrates, the court is never aware of much more than the tip of the
iceberg. To properly sort out this type of problem with its complex
technical and business overtones, one needs the type of investigative
resources as well as the ability to hold hearings that is possessed by
Congress.

These conclusions require us to reverse the entry of summary judgment
entered in favor of No Limit Films on Westbound's claims of copyright
infringement. Since the district judge found no infringement, there was
no necessity to consider the affirmative defense of "fair use." On
remand, the trial judge is free to consider this defense and we express
no opinion on its applicability to these facts.

## Future of Sampling

**"If you sample, you must license"** seems to be the rule following *Bridgeport*. But why? Why is this not subject to a simple fair use analysis?

## How To Acquire Music For Films

In general, there are 3 ways music is acquired for a film: (1) the filmmaker licenses music that already exists prior to filming, (2) the filmmaker hires an artist to re-record music for the film (usually used when you can't acquire a license), or (3) an artist or composer is hired to make new music specifically for the film being produced.

[From ASCAP.com](http://www.ascap.com/music-career/articles-advice/film-tv/how-to-acquire-music-for-films.aspx):

**Frequently Asked Questions For Student and Independent Filmmakers**

**Q:** What Licenses Must I Get To Use A Song In My Film?

**A:** If you are using a pre-recorded song or another pre-recorded piece of music in your film, there are two rights you need to clear; that is to say, you need to get two different licenses to use the music.

- **Synchronization License:** This is the right to synchronize a song or a piece of music with your visual image. It must be obtained from the copyright owner of the music, which is usually the publisher. You can find out who the publisher is by using ASCAP's Clearance Express (ACE) at www.ascap.com/ace. Songs that are not represented by ASCAP might be found at the National Music Publishers' Association "Songfile" website (www.nmpa.org).You will be provided with a contact at the publisher's Business Affairs or Licensing Department.

- **Master Use License:** This is the right to reproduce a specific recording of a song in your film. You clear this right with the record label who owns the specific recording you would like to use; see the liner notes of the recording to find out which company this is. Alternatively, you can get contact information for record labels by calling ASCAP's Film/TV Department. You will be provided with a contact at the record label's Business Affairs Department.

[Note: It's not a bad idea for filmmakers to also secure a **Performance License** and a **Videogram License**, which allows the film containing the song to be broadcast on television and copies of the film to be made and sold. Interestingly, in the United States, no special license is required to show the movie in a movie theater.]

**Q:** Can I Use These Songs On My Soundtrack Album?

**A:** If you intend to use these songs on a soundtrack album, you will need to negotiate additional soundtrack rights with the publisher and record label as you negotiate the synch and master use rights for your film.

####Music Licensing Agreements
Once a copyright owner agrees to let a filmmaker license their song for a film, best practice requires drawing up an official licensing contract. This license will usually be nonexclusive, meaning that the owner can allow anyone else they want to use the song as well (exclusive licenses are rarer and, understandably, harder to negotiate). A good licensing agreement will set forward **where the license applies** (the one receiving the license will want this to be broad as possible -- "the world", for example; but it will cost less to license for local use -- say, for a local television ad), all **forms of media** where the song will be used (not just "film", but broadcast, cable, and satellite television, in-flight movies, DVD, etc. -- again, the filmmaker will want this to be as broad as possible), and the **license fee** (for popular songs, a license can run you tens of thousands of dollars, and some copyright owners will want royalties, as well). If the filmmaker will be modifying the song in any way, they will need to include this in the license agreement.

####Re-recording and Sound-Alike Recordings
Some filmmakers choose to re-record a song in an effort to save some money on licensing fees. This option still requires obtaining licenses from the publishing company (you will still need a synchronization license, and performance and videogram licenses, if applicable). You will also need to hire musicians to do the new recording (which can have its own contracting foibles).

But, could you hire a cover band that sounds exactly like the artist denying your request to re-record the song so that the audience will be fooled into thinking it's the original song (known as a "sound-alike recording")? Probably not, as this may violate the original artist's right of publicity (this falls under the laws of unfair competition).

####Commissioning Music

Often, filmmakers want new music made specifically for their movie (think of the great movie composers, like John Williams or Hans Zimmer). Filmmakers will then negotiate a composer's service agreement that structures the relationship as a work made for hire. This solves the issue of ownership -- the rights to the recording and the composition itself will belong to the production company, not the composer.

## Film Options

#### Five Stages of Film Production

1. Development: Script gets written and approved. 
2. Pre-production: Cast and crew are hired, locations are selected, and sets are built.
3. Production: The raw elements for the finished film are recorded. (First Day of Principal Photography! Payday for many!)
4. Post-Production: The film is edited; music composed, performed, and recorded. 
5. Sales and distribution: The film is screened for potential buyers (distributors), who then distribute the film to its cinema and/or home media audience.

#### Why Option?

Licensing songs is one thing. Licensing film rights to a hot story property (novel, graphic novel, magazine article, hot nonfiction book) is a more expensive proposition. 

During development and pre-production (see 5 stages above), 
producers and studios are reluctant to buy or license film rights outright, 
because they are EXPENSIVE. 
The project could fall through at any time. 
Dozens of people all have to say “yes” on the same day to get a green light.
Until then, while in the early stages of film production, 
writers, producers, and studio execs like to OPTION film rights 
instead of buying them outright. 

#### The Movie Option 3 Essential Terms

1. The option period 
2. The option payment 
3. The purchase price 

##### 1. The Option Period

How many months or years will the option period last? Shorter is better for the copyright owner. Longer is better for the option owner (more time to attempt to get the project set up).

* Usually 6, 12, 18 months, sometimes two years. 
* Often includes an option to renew. 

##### 2. The Option Payment

* How Much Does the Option Cost? The price varies greatly.
* Rule of thumb: 10% of purchase price.
* AKA: The “small” money.

##### 3. The Purchase Price

What will happen if the buyer EXERCISES the option to buy? 
Mainly how much? $50k, $100k, usually more.

* Often a percentage of the total movie budget. 
* 1-3%, with a cap.
* The “big” money.
