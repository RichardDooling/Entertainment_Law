## Trademark 

### Lanham Act &sect; 43(a)

Trademarks are "brands" or "marks" 
associated with goods, services and commercial activities.
The Lanham Act, &sect; 43(a), 
prohibits false designations 
or representations of goods or services. 

> Any person who &hellip; uses in commerce 
> any word, term, name, symbol, or device &hellip; 
> or any false designation of origin, 
> false or misleading description of fact &hellip; 
> which &hellip; is likely to cause confusion &hellip; 
> mistake &hellip; or to deceive 
> as to the affiliation, connection or association 
> of such person with another person, 
> or as to the origin, sponsorship or approval 
> of his or her goods, services or commercial activities &hellip;

#### "Passing off," "Palming off," "Reverse passing off"

If an artist puts her name 
on someone else's goods or services 
and passes them off as her own, 
it is a trademark violation. 

If an artist removes someone's name from goods or services 
and then sells the product in an unbranded state 
or adds false designations of origin, 
it's called "reverse passing off." 
Also a trademark violation.

In the following case, 
two rock musicians removed two artists names from the credits, 
and falsely designated a third artist as an author.

###### United States Court Of Appeals Ninth Circuit (1988)

* [case on Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=847+F.2d+1403&appflag=67.12) 

DAVID R. THOMPSON, Circuit Judge:

The district court held that summary judgment was appropriate because
Lamothe and Jones failed to establish that section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a), provides relief to co-authors whose names have
been omitted from a record album cover and sheet music featuring the
co-authored compositions. Because the court concluded that no federal
cause of action existed, the court also dismissed the plaintiffs'
pendent state law claims for an accounting, defamation, and
misattribution of authorship.

We have jurisdiction of this appeal under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291, and we
reverse.

#### FACTS

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Lamothe and Jones,
the nonmoving parties, the facts pertinent to this appeal are that
Lamothe, Jones and Crosby are coauthors of two songs entitled "Scene of
the Crime," and "I'm Insane." These works were composed while Lamothe,
Jones and Crosby were members of a band called Mac Meda. After Mac Meda
disbanded, Crosby joined another musical group called RATT. While Crosby
was a member of RATT, he and Juan Croucier licensed the songs at issue
to Time Coast Music, which in turn sub-licensed the songs to other of
the defendants in this case, including Atlantic Recording. In 1984,
Atlantic released an album by the group RATT entitled "Out of the
Cellar," which included the recordings of the songs "Scene of the Crime"
and "I'm Insane." Because of the popularity of this album,
the music and lyrics for all compositions on the album were released in
sheet music form by the sub-licensee Chappell Music Co. In both versions
(album and sheet music), authorship of the music and lyrics of "I'm
Insane" was attributed solely to Robinson Crosby and the music and
lyrics of "Scene of the Crime" were attributed to Robinson Crosby and
Juan Croucier. Neither Robert Lamothe nor Ronald Jones received credit
for their roles in the writing of these songs.

### III

#### ANALYSIS

The principal issue on appeal is whether Lamothe and Jones have stated a
claim under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act &hellip; which
provides in pertinent part:

> Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with
> any goods or services ... a false designation of origin, or any false
> description or representation, including words or other symbols
> tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause
> such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any person who
> shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or
> description or representation cause or procure the same to be
> transported or used in commerce ... shall be liable to a civil action
> by any person ... who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged
> by the use of such false description or representation.

*Id.* The Lanham Act's prohibition of false designations or
representations reaches either goods or services sold in interstate
commerce. [*Smith v. Montoro,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210493150407072428)(9th Cir. 1981).
It has been applied to motion picture representations, *id.,* and the
defendants cite no case holding that it does not similarly reach musical
compositions. We also note that "[t]o recover for a violation of
[section 43(a)] it is not necessary that a mark or trade-mark be
registered. The dispositive question is whether the party has a
reasonable interest to be protected against false advertising." &hellip; 
Finally, we
recently have made clear that in cases involving false designation, the
actionable "conduct must not only be unfair but must in some discernable
way be competitive." [*Halicki v. United Artists Communications, Inc.,* (9th Cir. 1987)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12779534946996407153).
In the present case, the plaintiffs clearly have a legitimate interest
in protecting their work from being falsely designated as the creation
of another. The defendants do not dispute that the plaintiffs and Crosby
are competitors in the relevant market. Having determined that the
plaintiffs have an interest protected by the Lanham Act, we turn our
attention to whether the defendants' conduct in this case constitutes a
violation of section 43(a).

#### 1. *Prohibited Conduct Under Section 43(a)*

The Lanham Act applies to two different types of unfair competition in
interstate commerce. The first is "palming off" or "passing off," which
involves selling a good or service of one person's creation under the
name or mark of another. [*Smith v. Montoro,* (9th
Cir. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210493150407072428).
Section 43(a) also reaches false advertising about the goods or services
of the advertiser. [*U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v. Jartran, Inc.,* (9th
Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16808466954150620657).
Because we conclude that Lamothe and Jones, for purposes of surviving a
motion for summary judgment, have produced evidence satisfying the
elements of a "reverse passing off" claim, we need not decide whether
the defendants' actions also constitute false advertising.

#### 2. *Passing Off*

The leading case in this circuit discussing the "passing off" doctrine
embodied in section 43(a) is [*Smith v. Montoro,* (9th
Cir. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210493150407072428).
In that case, an actor named Paul Smith had contracted to star in a
film. Smith's contract provided that he would receive star billing in
the screen credits and any advertising associated with the distribution
of the film. A licensee of the production company subsequently removed
Smith's name from the screen credits and advertising materials and
substituted the name of another actor, "Bob Spencer." 
Smith sued the production company and its licensee, alleging a violation
of the Lanham Act. The district court dismissed the complaint because it
did not allege a practice "in the nature of, or economically equivalent
to, palming off ... and/or misuse of trademarks and trade names." 
We disagreed and reversed the case and remanded it to the
district court to reinstate Smith's complaint.

We began our analysis in *Smith* by defining "passing off" as the
practice of selling one person's product or service under the name or
mark of another. *Id.* Passing off may be either "express" or "implied."
*Id.* Express passing off occurs when a business labels its goods or
services with a mark identical to that of another enterprise, or
otherwise expressly misrepresents the origin of the goods or services.
*Id.* Implied passing off involves the use of a competitor's advertising
material, or a sample or photograph of the competitor's product, to
impliedly represent that the product being sold is made by the
competitor. *Id.*

In *Smith,* we further explained that section 43(a) also encompasses
merchandising "practices or conduct 'economically equivalent' to
palming off."  Among those practices is "reverse passing
off," which may be either "express" or "implied." Express reverse
passing off is "accomplished ... when the wrongdoer removes the name or
trademark on another party's product and sells that product under a name
chosen by the wrongdoer." *Id.* Implied reverse passing off is
accomplished simply by removing or obliterating the name of the source
and then selling the product in an unbranded state. *Id.*

We concluded in *Smith* that by deleting Smith's name from the film and
advertising materials and substituting the name "Bob Spencer," the
defendants had engaged in express reverse passing off. We explained that

> [a]s a matter of policy, such conduct, like traditional palming off,
> is wrongful because it involves an attempt to misappropriate
>  or profit from
> another's talents and workmanship. Moreover, in reverse palming off
> cases, the originator of the misidentified product is involuntarily
> deprived of the advertising value of [his] name and the goodwill that
> otherwise would stem from public knowledge of the true source of the
> satisfactory product. The ultimate purchaser (or viewer) is also
> deprived of knowing the true source of the product and may even be
> deceived into believing that it comes from a different source.

*Id.* at 607 (citations omitted). In the present case, taking the
allegations of the complaint as true, the defendants engaged in express
reverse palming off, by which they deprived Lamothe and Jones of
recognition and profits from the release of the two songs that were
their due.

The defendants' argument on appeal, reduced to its simplest form, is
that there can be no express reverse passing off when the designation of
a product's source is partially correct. Defendants argue that the
failure to attribute authorship to Lamothe and Jones is a "mere
omission," which is not actionable under section 43(a). We disagree. We
do not read the "falsity" requirement in origination cases so narrowly
that a partially accurate designation of origin, which obscures the
contribution of another to the final product, is a permissible form of
competition.&hellip; 

In the present case, the defendants unilaterally decided to attribute
authorship to less than all of the joint authors of the musical
compositions. Had the defendants decided to attribute authorship to a
fictitious person, to the group "RATT," or to some other person, this
would be a false designation of origin. It seems to us no less "false"
to attribute authorship to only one of several co-authors. *Cf.*
[*Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Co.'s,* (2d
Cir. 1976)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13301454329958507401)
(stating in dicta that broadcasting heavily edited version of "Monty
Python's Flying Circus" without appropriate disclaimer that authors had
not approved editing amounted to violation of section 43(a)); *id.* at
26 (Gurfein, J., concurring) ("So long as it is made clear that the ABC
version is not approved by the Monty Python group, there is no
misdescription of origin."). The policies we identified in *Smith,*
namely, ensuring that the producer of a good or service receives
appropriate recognition and that the consuming public receives full
information about the origin of the good, apply with equal
 force here. An
incomplete designation of the source of the good or service is no less
misleading because it is partially correct. Misbranding a product to
only partially identify its source is the economic equivalent of passing
off one person's product under the name or mark of another. And the
*Smith* case makes clear that in assessing section 43(a) claims, courts
are to consider whether the challenged "practices or conduct [are]
'economically equivalent' to palming off." [*Smith*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210493150407072428).

#### 3. *Liability of Licensees*

Atlantic Recording and the other licensees or sublicensees of Crosby and
Croucier argue that even if Lamothe and Jones have stated a section
43(a) claim, they cannot be held liable because they are licensees. We
disagree. Some of the licensees may have been involved in affixing an
incomplete designation of authorship. These licensees would be liable
under section 43(a) regardless of knowledge. *See* 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a).
The express language of section 43(a) also imposes liability upon those
who "with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin ...
cause or procure the same to be transported or used in commerce." *Id.*
The licensees have cited no case holding that a licensee is exempt from
the prohibitions of the Lanham Act. Whether the licensees affixed the
incomplete authorship or had knowledge of the false designation of
origin are matters best left to the trier of fact to resolve.

### IV

#### CONCLUSION

Because we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate, we reverse
the decision of the district court and remand the case with instructions
to reinstate Lamothe's and Jones's federal causes of action.&hellip; 

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

#### Summary & Notes

Lamothe, Jones and Crosby had a band called Mac Meda and jointly authored two songs entitled "Scene of the Crime" and "I'm Insane." 

The Mac Meda band broke up, and Crosby joined a band called RATT. Atlantic Records released an album by RATT, which included the two songs โScene of the Crimeโ and "I'm Insane."

The songs were attributed to Crosby and Croucier (another member of RATT). The other two members of Mac Meda, Lamothe and Jones, who had jointly authored "Scene of the Crime" and "I'm Insane" received no credit. 

Lamothe and Jones sued Crosby, Croucier and Atlantic under the Lanham Trademark Act, Section 43(a), which prohibits false designations and false representations likely to cause confusion about the origins of the songs.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Lamothe and Jones:

> In the present case, the [musicians] clearly have a legitimate interest in protecting their work from being falsely designated as the creation of another.

### The *Polaroid* test

To state a claim for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 
the plaintiff must show that the defendant's use of its mark 
is likely to cause an appreciable 
number of ordinarily prudent purchasers "confusion as to the origin,
sponsorship, or approval" of the defendant's product.&hellip; 

Courts look to the eight
factor test first articulated in [*Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs.
Corp.,* (2d Cir.1961),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2293827617926067028)
to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion.
When applying these factors, courts try to focus "on the ultimate
question of whether consumers are likely to be confused." &hellip; 

The *Polaroid* factors are: 

1. the strength of the senior mark; 
2. the degree of similarity between the two marks; 
3. the proximity of the products; 
4. the likelihood that the prior owner will "bridge the gap"; 
5. actual confusion; 
6. the defendant's good faith (or bad faith) in adopting its own mark; 
7. the quality of defendant's product; and 
8. the sophistication of the buyers. 

[*Polaroid,* 287 F.2d at 495](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2293827617926067028).

In the following case, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals applies those eight factors to decide whether Jim Henson's character "Spa'am" from *Muppett Treasure Island* infringes on Hormel's Spam products.

VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge:

Hormel Foods Corporation appeals 
from a judgment of the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of New York (Wood, J.) denying
Hormel's request for a permanent injunction 
against Jim Henson Productions, Inc.&hellip; 
Hormel originally contended 
that Henson's use of the character 
"Spa'am" in its upcoming movie 
and related merchandise 
would infringe and/or dilute Hormel's trademark in the luncheon meat SPAM, 
but now limits its argument to the merchandising use. 
With respect to that use, 
Hormel argues that the district court erred in finding no infringement 
and that it misinterpreted New York's anti-dilution statute, 
N.Y.Gen. Bus.Law ยง 368-d (McKinney 1984). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.

### BACKGROUND

Since 1937, Hormel has used the trademark name "SPAM" to market its
luncheon meat. It is beyond dispute that SPAM is a distinctive, widely
recognized mark.&hellip;

In February 1996, Henson plans to release the film *Muppet Treasure
Island* which features Henson's widely popular cast of puppets, known
collectively as the "Muppets." The film will use some of Henson's most
familiar characters, including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and Fozzie
Bear. A number of additional characters have been created
 for this production,
among whom is Spa'am, the subject of this litigation. The similarity
between the name "Spa'am" and Hormel's mark is not accidental. In
Henson's film, Spa'am is the high priest of a tribe of wild boars that
worships Miss Piggy as its Queen Sha Ka La Ka La. Although the name
"Spa'am" is mentioned only once in the entire movie, Henson hopes to
poke a little fun at Hormel's famous luncheon meat by associating its
processed, gelatinous block with a humorously wild beast.

However, the executives at Hormel are not amused. 
They worry that sales of SPAM will drop off 
if it is linked with "evil in porcine form." 
Spa'am, however, 
is not the boarish Beelzebub that Hormel seems to fear. 
The district court credited and relied upon the
testimony of Anne Devereaux Jordan, an expert in children's literature,
to find that Spa'am is a positive figure in the context of the movie as
a whole โ even if he is not "classically handsome." &hellip; 
Indeed, Spa'am is a comic character who "seems childish rather than evil." 
Although he is humorously threatening in his first appearance, 
he comes to befriend the Muppets and helps them escape from
the film's villain, Long John Silver. By film's end, "Spa'am is shown
sailing away with the other Muppets as good humor and camaraderie
reign." 

Hormel also expresses concern that even comic association with an
unclean "grotesque" boar will call into question the purity and high
quality of its meat product. But the district court found no evidence
that Spa'am was unhygienic. At worst, he might be described as "untidy."
*Id.* Moreover, by now Hormel should be inured to
any such ridicule. Although SPAM is in fact made from pork shoulder and
ham meat, and the name itself supposedly is a portmanteau word for
spiced ham, countless jokes have played off the public's unfounded
suspicion that SPAM is a product of less than savory ingredients. For
example, in one episode of the television cartoon *Duckman,* Duckman is
shown discovering "the secret ingredient to SPAM" as he looks on at
"Murray's Incontinent Camel Farm." In a recent newspaper column it was
noted that "[I]n one little can, Spam contains the five major food
groups: Snouts. Ears. Feet. Tails. Brains." Mike Thomas, *Ready? Set?
No!,* The Orlando Sentinel, June 25, 1995, at 30. In view of the more or
less humorous takeoffs such as these, one might think Hormel would
welcome the association with a genuine source of pork. Nevertheless, on
July 25, 1995, Hormel filed this suit alleging both trademark
infringement and dilution.

The district court found that the presence of the character named
"Spa'am" in the film constituted neither infringement nor dilution, and
Hormel does not contest this conclusion here. Rather, this appeal
concerns Henson's proposed use of the Spa'am likeness with and without
the name "Spa'am" on movie-related merchandise &hellip; 
Henson has shelved its plans to place the name
"Spa'am" on its *Muppet Treasure Island* merchandise pending the outcome
of this litigation. However, according to Henson's proposals &hellip; if it were permitted to go ahead with its plans, the merchandise
would carry only the Spa'am likeness or the Spa'am likeness beside the
name "Spa'am." The name "Spa'am" would not appear alone. Moreover, any
merchandise in which Spa'am appeared would clearly display the words
"Muppet Treasure Island."

Henson's plans nevertheless concern Hormel, which has begun
merchandising items featuring SPAM. These secondary products include
clothing, watches, golf balls, and toy cars โ some of the same items
Henson's licensees would like to issue. In addition, Hormel markets its
luncheon meat with a 
character it calls "SPAM-man," essentially a giant can of SPAM with arms
and legs. Hormel is worried that sales of merchandise featuring Spa'am
will directly cut into the sales of secondary SPAM items. The district
court found, however, that "[p]urchasers of the secondary [SPAM]
products are generally consumers of the luncheon meat and associate the
secondary products with the luncheon meat." Slip Op. at 3.

Moreover, the Muppets are familiar to television and motion picture
audiences, and they are "well-known for parodies of brand names,
trademarks, television programs, fictional characters, and celebrities."
*Id.* at 3. The district court found that "[c]hildren
who enjoy the Muppets are familiar with the Muppet brand of humor and
are unlikely to think that the Muppets are sponsored by the products and
celebrities who are the subject of their jokes." *Id.*
This undoubtedly led to the court's further finding that "[c]onsumers of
merchandise bearing the likeness and/or name of Spa'am will buy it
because they like Spa'am, the Muppets, and/or *Muppet Treasure Island* โ
not because they mistakenly think it is SPAM-related merchandise." *Id.*
at 8.

Hormel points out that some newspaper accounts already have confused the
names "SPAM" and "Spa'am." Hormel directed the district court's
attention to several news articles which evidenced some confusion
concerning the spelling, pronunciation, and use of the two words.
However, each of them antedated the initial public showing of *Muppet
Treasure Island.*

### DISCUSSION

### A. Trademark Infringement

A plaintiff's trademark is protected by federal law against infringement
by use of colorable imitations of the mark which are "likely to cause
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive." 15 U.S.C. ยง 1114(1). The
central inquiry is whether there is a "likelihood of confusion," a
"likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers
are likely to be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of
the goods in question," [*Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R.G. Barry Corp.,*
(2d Cir. 1978),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=960951309812304151)
or that there may be confusion as to plaintiff's sponsorship or
endorsement of the junior mark. *See* [*Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,
Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd.,* (2d Cir. 1979)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11014508973363071529).

In this circuit, claims for infringement usually are analyzed under the
eight factor *Polaroid* test. *See* [*Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad
Electronics Corp.,* (2d Cir.),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2293827617926067028)
In the instant case, the district court found that each of the eight
factors favored Henson as to both use of the Spa'am likeness alone and
use of the Spa'am likeness in conjunction with the name "Spa'am" on its
merchandise. Finding no other circumstances tending to create confusion,
it concluded that there was no likelihood of confusion and rejected
Hormel's claim. Although we review de novo the district court's
comprehensive application of the *Polaroid* factors, the district
court's determinations as to each of the factors are factual in nature.
These findings will be disturbed only if clearly erroneous. Moreover,
because we are reviewing the district court's decision after a bench
trial on the merits, we give special deference to the court's
determinations of witness credibility. [*Anderson v. City of Bessemer
City,* (S.Ct. 1985)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4660598599950299463).
With the foregoing in mind, we examine each of the *Polaroid* factors in
turn.

#### *Strength of the Mark*

There is little doubt that SPAM is a distinctive, widely recognized
trademark. Hormel has sold over five billion cans of its luncheon meat
under the SPAM mark and invested millions of dollars in advertising. As
a result, Hormel has a 75 percent share of the canned meat market and
SPAM is eaten in 30 percent of all American homes. Thus, SPAM truly is a
household name. In the 
usual trademark case, such an undeniably strong mark would be a factor
favoring the trademark plaintiff. The more deeply a plaintiff's mark is
embedded in the consumer's mind, the more likely it is that the
defendant's mark will conjure up the image of the plaintiff's product
instead of that of the junior user. 

However, this does not always lead to confusion. As then District Judge
Leval explained in [*Yankee Publishing Inc. v. News America Publishing
Inc.,* (S.D.N.Y.1992),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10303687158773885878)
"[w]here the plaintiff's mark is being used as part of a jest or
commentary.... [and] both plaintiff['s] and defendant's marks are
strong, well recognized, and clearly associated in the consumers' mind
with a particular distinct ethic ... confusion is avoided...." Indeed, a
parody depends on a lack of confusion to make its point. "A parody must
convey two simultaneous โ and contradictory โ messages: that it is the
original, but also that it is *not* the original and is instead a
parody." [*Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group,
Inc.,* (2d
Cir. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3543157455154245054)
(emphasis in original).

Henson's use of the name "Spa'am" is simply another in a long line of
Muppet lampoons. Moreover, this Muppet brand of humor is widely
recognized and enjoyed. Thus, consumers of Henson's merchandise, all of
which will display the words "Muppet Treasure Island," are likely to see
the name "Spa'am" as the joke it was intended to be &hellip; Henson's parody is not particularly
subtle.

We find, therefore, that the clarity of Henson's parodic intent, the
widespread familiarity with Henson's Muppet parodies, and the strength
of Hormel's mark, all weigh strongly against the likelihood of confusion
as to source or sponsorship between Hormel's mark and the name "Spa'am."
Moreover, this reasoning applies to both use of the Spa'am character
likeness alone and use of the likeness and name together on Henson's
movie merchandise.

#### *Degree of Similarity Between the Marks*

Although Henson's wild boar puppet in no way resembles Hormel's luncheon
meat or SPAM-man, Hormel contends that depiction of the puppet alone
will conjure up the name "Spa'am," because consumers will associate the
name that appears in the movie and media with the figure on Henson's
merchandise. Thus, Hormel argues, use of the puppet likeness alone is in
essence no different than its use in conjunction with its name. However,
even combined use of the name and likeness does not present a strong
case of similarity. Viewed alone, of course, the names "Spa'am" and
"SPAM" bear more than a passing resemblance. Indeed, Henson's parody
depends on the correspondence between the two. However, there are also
some significant differences. "Spa'am" is divided in two by an
apostrophe and it contains two "a"s instead of one. In addition, Spa'am
is pronounced as two distinct syllables, SPAM only one.

Moreover, "an inquiry into the degree of similarity between two marks
does not end with a comparison of the marks themselves.... \`the setting
in which a designation is used affects its appearance and colors the
impression conveyed by it.'" [*Spring Mills, Inc. v. Ultracashmere
House, Ltd.,* (2d Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3429743328705863564)

In this connection, 
placement of the marks next to other identifying but
dissimilar symbols is clearly relevant. Here, Henson plans to always use
the name "Spa'am" next to a likeness of the wild boar  puppet. In addition, the words "Muppet
Treasure Island" always will be prominently displayed wherever the name
"Spa'am" appears. Thus, the two marks appear in strikingly different
contexts and project wholly different visual displays. Moreover, the
prominence of Henson's mark, widely recognized as a source of satire,
will make it clear that the merchandise itself parodies Hormel's
product, a message which depends for its success on distinguishing
Spa'am from SPAM. 
Therefore, although the two marks are superficially similar, in all
likelihood the parodic context in which the name "Spa'am" appears will
distinguish the marks in the consumer's mind.

#### *Proximity of the Products*

Our finding that the marks are dissimilar in practice is buttressed by
the fact that Henson and Hormel occupy distinct merchandising markets.
The district court found that SPAM merchandise and Muppet merchandise
featuring Spa'am "[c]learly ... derive their associations from a primary
product โ luncheon meat, in the case of SPAM, and a Muppet motion
picture, in the case of Spa'am." Slip Op. at 13. It
noted that "purchasers of SPAM merchandise would generally be consumers
of the luncheon meat," *id.,* and that "[c]onsumers of merchandise
bearing the likeness and/or name of Spa'am will buy it because they like
Spa'am, the Muppets, and/or *Muppet Treasure Island.*" *Id.* at 8. Thus, the separation between the markets for luncheon meat
and puppet entertainment carries over into the secondary merchandising
market.

This finding is not clearly erroneous. Our opinion in [*Universal City
Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co.,* (2d Cir. 1984)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18336133881200662092)
explains why. In that case, the competing marks "King Kong" and "Donkey
Kong" appeared in different primary markets โ motion pictures and video
games respectively. As to secondary products featuring Donkey Kong, we
noted that "since the videogame [Donkey Kong] is by far the dominant
source of goodwill for these characters, consumer impressions of these
other items are likely to be generated by the videogame, diminishing the
possibility that the items will create more confusion among consumers
than the videogame itself." *Id.* at 117 n. 7. Likewise, the character
Spa'am, even as he appears on merchandise, will be defined almost
entirely by his appearance in *Muppet Treasure Island.* This connection
will be strengthened by the presence of the *Muppet Treasure Island*
logo. Thus, it is unlikely that consumers will confuse merchandise
featuring Spa'am with similar items displaying the SPAM trademark.

#### *Bridging the Gap*

Bridging the gap refers to the "senior user's interest in preserving
avenues of expansion and entering into related fields." [*C.L.A.S.S.
Promotions, Inc. v. D.S. Magazines, Inc.,* (2d Cir. 1985)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8066359022809548671).
Hormel has shown no intention of entering the field of puppet
entertainment with its attendant merchandising, *see*
[*McGregor-Doniger, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=989627832648708428)
and there is no evidence that consumers would relate Hormel to such an
enterprise. 
Because market proximity in the instant case depends on identification
with the primary product, this factor too favors Henson.

#### *Actual Confusion*

Hormel points to the misspellings and mispronunciations of Spa'am as
SPAM in the media as evidence of actual confusion. However, in none of
the articles Hormel cites is the source or sponsorship of the two marks
confused. Indeed, there is no evidence that consumers, members of the
media, or anyone else has mistaken Spa'am as a promotional figure for
SPAM, or as a character sponsored by Hormel. Accordingly, the district
court found that there was no actual confusion. Although misspellings
may demonstrate a possibility of confusion, the vastly different
contexts in which the marks at issue herein will appear militate against
any possible confusion as to source or sponsorship.

####  *Bad Faith*

As noted above, Henson's parody depends on consumer recognition that
Spa'am is a Muppet lampoon and not simply a modified version of the
SPAM-man. As the court noted in [*Yankee Publishing,
supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10303687158773885878)*,*
"[Henson] would have absolutely nothing to gain from creating a
confusion among [merchandise consumers] causing them to believe there
was a business association between [Henson] and [Hormel]." [809 F. Supp
at 275](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10303687158773885878).
Indeed, the lack of subtlety in Henson's parody is evidence in itself
that Henson intended no deceit. *See* [*Tetley, Inc. v. Topps Chewing
Gum, Inc.,* (E.D.N.Y.1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3692925699656865799).
There is nothing to indicate that Henson acted in bad faith.

#### *Quality of the Products*

The quality of a junior user's product can be relevant in two ways: (1)
an inferior product may cause injury to the plaintiff trademark owner
because people may think that the senior and junior products came from
the same source; or (2) products of equal quality may tend to create
confusion as to source because of this very similarity. *See* [*Nikon
Inc. v. Ikon Corp.,* (2d Cir. 1993)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13183511391101539790).
Henson's Muppets, which now include Spa'am among their members, are high
quality products, similar in this respect to Hormel's SPAM. However,
similarity of quality as between SPAM and Spa'am is unlikely to cause
confusion, because the products are not otherwise related as to makeup,
usage, etc.

Yet, although Henson's Muppets present high quality entertainment,
Hormel contends that Henson's Spa'am character will call into question
the quality of its SPAM luncheon meat. However, Hormel overlooks the
district court's findings that Spa'am is a positive character, that he
is not unhygienic, and that a simple comic reference to the fact that
SPAM is made from pork will not damage its image, especially in view of
the lack of adverse effect from the numerous other humorous references
to SPAM.

#### *Consumer Sophistication*

The district court found that a child or adult who would be likely to
buy merchandise featuring Spa'am would do so "because he likes the
Muppets, not because he mistakenly thinks that it is a SPAM [product]."
Slip Op. at 17. Hormel complains that the district court
focused on consumers who want to purchase Spa'am merchandise while
overlooking possible confusion on the part of those who would like to
buy SPAM products. However, although the district court did not discuss
the latter consumers in its sophistication analysis, it found in its
discussion of market proximity that consumers who want to purchase SPAM
merchandise do so to affiliate themselves with Hormel's primary product
and would not be confused by Henson's merchandise, all of which will
prominently carry the *Muppet Treasure Island* mark. This finding is
relevant in the sophistication analysis, especially because
sophistication and market proximity are closely related concepts. *See*
[*Vitarroz, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14906832319771429677).
Therefore, we find no error in the district court's reasoning.

#### *Likelihood of Confusion*

The elements of parody in Henson's Spa'am merchandise distinguish those
products from ones manufactured by Hormel. The obvious, though
inoffensive, nature of the parody and the prominence of the *Muppet
Treasure Island* mark are strong evidence that consumers are not likely
to be confused between merchandise carrying the SPAM logo and products
featuring Spa'am. This is true both as to use of the Spa'am likeness and
use of the Spa'am name in conjunction with that likeness, as portrayed
in Henson's plans submitted to the district court. We therefore conclude
that Hormel's infringement claim is without merit.

### B. Trademark Dilution

Hormel asserts error in the district court's conclusion that use of the
Spa'am likeness, both with and without the name "Spa'am," will not
dilute Hormel's SPAM trademark under New York's anti-dilution statute.&hellip;

Dilution is grounded on the idea that a trademark can lose its "ability
&hellip; to clearly and unmistakably distinguish one source" through
unauthorized use. 

In order to establish a dilution claim, two elements must be shown: (1)
ownership of a distinctive mark, and (2) a likelihood of dilution.
[*Sally Gee, Inc. v. Myra Hogan, Inc.,* (2d Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=247992148676766369).
It is beyond dispute that SPAM is an extremely strong mark. Thus, this
case turns on the question whether there is a likelihood of dilution.
Such a likelihood can be established by a showing either of blurring or
of tarnishment. Hormel contends that Henson's merchandise will dilute
its mark under both theories. We disagree.

#### *Blurring*

Dilution by blurring occurs when 
"[c]ustomers or prospective customers &hellip; 
see the plaintiff's mark used on a plethora of different goods and
services." &hellip; "Thus, dilution by
'blurring' may occur where the defendant uses or modifies *the
plaintiff's trademark* to identify *the defendant's goods and services,*
raising the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as
a unique identifier of the plaintiff's product." [*Deere & Co. v. MTD
Prods., Inc.,* (2d Cir. 1994)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11078526421590500494)
(emphasis in original). This injury to the mark's selling power need not
involve any confusion as to source or sponsorship. [*Sally Gee, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=247992148676766369).
The unauthorized pullulation itself causes the harm. The legislative
history of ยง 368-d underscores this understanding by giving examples of
hypothetical violations: "DuPont shoes, Buick aspirin tablets, Schlitz
varnish, Kodak pianos, Bulova gowns, and so forth." 

There is very little likelihood that Henson's parody will weaken the
association between the mark SPAM and Hormel's luncheon meat. Instead,
like other spoofs, Henson's parody will "\'tend to increase public
identification'" of Hormel's mark with Hormel.&hellip;

This conclusion is strengthened when we consider that Henson's parody
undermines any superficial similarities the marks might share. As we
noted above, the name "Spa'am" will always appear next to the character
likeness and the words "Muppet Treasure Island." This dissimilarity
alone could defeat Hormel's blurring claim, for in order to establish
dilution by blurring, the two marks must not only be similar, they "must
be 'very' or 'substantially' similar." [*Mead Data Central, Inc. v.
Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.,* (2d Cir. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10399856046401781554).
Moreover, Henson is not using the name "Spa'am" as a product brand name.
Rather, Spa'am is a character in products branded with Henson's own
trademark "Muppet Treasure Island." This tends to dissipate the fear
that SPAM will no longer be considered a unique product identifier.
Viewed against the backdrop of Henson's transparent parodic intent and
the contextual dissimilarity between the two marks, it is clear that use
of the name "Spa'am" does not blur Hormel's mark.

####  *Tarnishment*

Dilution may also occur by tarnishment. A trademark may be tarnished
when it is "linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed in an
unwholesome or unsavory context," with the result that "the public will
associate the lack of quality or lack of prestige in the defendant's
goods with the plaintiff's unrelated goods." [*Deere & Co., supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11078526421590500494).
The mark may also be tarnished if it loses its ability to serve as a
"wholesome identifier" of plaintiff's product. *Id.*

Tarnishment can occur through a variety of uses. Some cases have found
that a mark is tarnished when its likeness is placed in the context of
sexual activity, obscenity, or illegal activity. *See, e.g.,* [*Eastman
Kodak Co. v. Rakow,* (W.D.N.Y.1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18366776276641723279);
[*Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd.,* (S.D.N.Y)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4398729965656614180).),
*aff'd,* [(2d
Cir. 1979)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11014508973363071529);
[*Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions, Inc.,* (N.D.Ga.
1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=7033763304563322440).
However, tarnishment is not limited to seamy conduct. 
Hormel argues that the image of Spa'am, as a "grotesque," "untidy" wild
boar will "inspire negative and unsavory associations with SPAMยฎ
luncheon meat." Both Hormel and Amicus Curiae rely heavily on our recent
decision in [*Deere,
supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11078526421590500494)*,*
for the proposition that products that "pok[e] fun at widely recognized
marks of non-competing products, risk diluting the selling power of the
mark that is made fun of." [41 F.3d at
44](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11078526421590500494)
(citation omitted). Their reliance is misplaced.

\* \* \*

The sine qua non of tarnishment is a finding that plaintiff's mark will
suffer negative associations through defendant's use. Hormel claims that
linking its luncheon meat with a wild boar will adversely color
consumers' impressions of SPAM. However, the district court found that
Spa'am, a likeable, positive character, will not generate any negative
associations. Moreover, contrary to Hormel's contentions, the district
court also found no evidence that Spa'am is unhygienic or that his
character places Hormel's mark in an unsavory context. Indeed, many of
Henson's own plans involve placing the Spa'am likeness on food products.
In addition, the court also noted that a simple humorous reference to
the fact that SPAM is made from pork is unlikely to tarnish Hormel's
mark. Absent any showing that Henson's use will create negative
associations with the SPAM mark, there was little likelihood of
dilution. *See* [*Tetley, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3692925699656865799).

Moreover, unlike *Deere,* Henson's merchandise will not be in direct
competition with that of Hormel. This is an important, even if not
determinative, factor. "Dilution of this sort is more likely to be found
when  the alterations
are made by a competitor with both an incentive to diminish the
favorable attributes of the mark and an ample opportunity to promote its
products in ways that make no significant alteration." [*Deere, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11078526421590500494).
Here, Henson does not seek to ridicule SPAM in order to sell more of its
competitive products; rather, the parody is part of the product itself.
Without Spa'am, the joke is lost. Indeed, we were mindful of this
problem in *Deere* when we noted that "[t]he line-drawing in this area
becomes especially difficult when a mark is parodied for the dual
purposes of making a satiric comment and selling a somewhat competing
product." *Id.* Thus, in *Deere* we did not proscribe any parody or
humorous depiction of a mark. Overall, we took a cautious approach,
stating that "we must be careful not to broaden section 368-d to
prohibit all uses of a distinctive mark that the owner prefers not be
made." *Id.* at 44.

Therefore, in the instant case, where (1) there is no evidence that
Henson's use will cause negative associations, (2) Henson is not a
direct competitor, and (3) the parody inheres in the product, we find
that there is no likelihood of dilution under a tarnishment theory.

\* \* \*

We affirm the district court's denial of injunctive relief.

R. GARY KLAUSNER, District Judge.

### I. *INTRODUCTION*

A few months before the 2008 Presidential election, Jackson Browne
("Browne" or "Plaintiff") sued Republican Presidential candidate,
Senator John McCain ("Senator McCain"), along with the Republican
National Committee ("RNC"), and the Ohio Republican Party ("ORP")
(collectively "Defendants") for copyright infringement, and other
related claims. Browne's claims arise out of Defendants' alleged
improper use of his song *Running on Empty* in a campaign commercial for
Senator McCain.

Presently before the Court is RNC's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to
State a Claim. For the following reasons, the Court DENIES RNC's Motion.

###II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff alleges the following facts:

Browne is a singer and songwriter who is closely associated with liberal
causes and Democratic political candidates. Browne's
public support for the Democratic Party and President Barack Obama is
well-known. In fact, Browne has performed at political
rallies for Democratic Party candidates. 

Senator McCain is a citizen of Arizona and ran as the Republican
Presidential candidate in the 2008 Presidential election. RNC is a non-profit political organization based in the District of
Columbia. ORP is a non-profit political organization based
in Ohio. 

#### A. *The Composition*

In 1977, Browne released an album entitled *Running on Empty* (the
"Album"),  which
contained a composition of the same name (the "Composition"). The Album reached platinum status (i.e., sales of one million or
more) seven times over. The Album and Composition are both
famously associated with Browne, who owns a federally registered
copyright in the Composition. It is that Composition
that Browne alleges Defendants improperly used in a campaign commercial
for Senator McCain.&hellip; 

#### B. *The Commercial*

In anticipation of then-Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama's
visit to Ohio the week of August 4, 2008, ORP, acting as an agent for
the RNC and Senator McCain, created a web video to criticize and comment
on Barack Obama's energy policy and his suggestion that the country
could conserve gasoline by keeping their automobile tires inflated to
the proper pressure (the "Commercial"). During the
Commercial, a sound recording of Browne performing the Composition,
*Running on Empty,* plays in the background. 

The Commercial is approximately one minute and twenty seconds. It begins by displaying the words "Pain at the Pump"
in large white and black letters, with bluish-pink graphics, followed by
a twenty-five second montage of Ohio news broadcasts regarding the high
price of gas. The montage features reporters from Channels 5, 6,
and 10, who state: (1) "we don't have to say it, we are all certainly
sick of the pain at the pump"; (2) "now the price at the pump is going
up once again"; (3) "$3.64 for a gallon"; (4) "gallon of regular going
for $3.69"; (5) "gas prices are thirty-eight percent higher now than
they were this time last year"; and (6) "for most of us, fill-up can be
a budget buster." The montage concludes with a Channel 5 reporter
asking "so how do you bring down the price of gas here in northeast Ohio
and across the U.S.A.?"

The Commercial then cuts to a CNN broadcast of then-Democratic candidate
Barack Obama at a rally saying "making sure your tires are properly
inflated." The sound of a needle dragged across a record is heard
as the screen flashes the word "What!?" Next, an image of Senator
McCain appears, along with the words "Senator McCain has [illegible]." The Commercial then cuts to information on Senator McCain's energy
plan, including the words: "Expand Domestic Oil and Natural Gas
Production; Reform Transportation Sector; Invest in Clean, Alternative
Sources of Energy; Address Climate Change; Promote Energy Efficiency."

 At approximately
thirty-seven seconds, the Commercial cuts to Senator McCain at a rally
saying "my friends this is a national security issue and who is paying
the most today, who is bearing the burden? Low income Americans who are
driving the oldest automobiles. We owe it to them and we owe it to all
Americans." 

At approximately fifty seconds, the Instrumental Introduction of the
Composition begins playing as the screen displays the words "What's that
Obama plan again?" At approximately fifty-seven seconds, the
volume on the Composition is lowered, but is still audible, and the
Commercial cuts back to the CNN broadcast of Obama at a rally saying
"making sure your tires are properly inflated, simple thing, but we
could save all the oil that they are talking about getting off drilling
if everybody was just inflating their tires?" At approximately one
minute eight seconds, the volume of the Composition increases as the
Commercial cuts to a CNN broadcast of former Presidential candidate
Senator Hillary Clinton saying "shame on you Barack Obama." 

At approximately one minute ten seconds, the Commercial cuts to a photo
of Barack Obama with the words "Barack Obama: No Solutions," which
changes to "Baraek Obama: Not Ready to Lead" as Browne is heard singing
the Chorus of the Composition.

The Commercial then concludes with a black screen containing small print
at the bottom that reads "Paid for by the Ohio Republican Party.
www.ohiogop.org. Not authorized by any candidate or candidate
committee."

Neither Senator McCain, ORP, nor RNC received a license nor Browne's
permission to use the Composition in the Commercial. 

ORP posted the Commercial on You-Tube.com ("YouTube").
The Commercial also aired on television and cable networks in Ohio and
Pennsylvania, as well as other websites such as the Huffingtonpost.com.
 The Commercial was also aired on and discussed by the national
news media, including MSNBC.

Since the Commercial first appeared on television and the Internet,
Browne has received numerous inquiries expressing concern about
Defendants' use of the Composition and Browne's performance. 

Browne contends that the Commercial falsely suggests that he sponsors,
endorses, or is associated with Senator McCain and the Republican Party,
"when nothing could be further from the truth." 

As a result, Browne sued Defendants on August 14, 2008, asserting claims
for (1) Copyright Infringement, (2) Vicarious Copyright Infringement,
(3) Violation of the Lanham Act (False Association or Endorsement), and
(4) Violation of California Common Law Right of Publicity.

###  DISCUSSION

[Court's discussion of plaintiff's copyright claims omitted.]

#### C. *Lanham Act Claim*

RNC contends that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs Lanham Act claim
because:

1. the Lanham Act applies only to commercial speech, 
2. the First Amendment and artistic relevance test bar the claim, and
3. Plaintiff cannot, as a matter of law, establish likelihood of confusion.
For the following reasons, the Court disagrees.

#### *1. Application of the Lanham Act to Political Speech*

RNC contends that Plaintiff cannot state a claim for false association
or endorsement under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act
("Section 43(a)(1)(A)") because the Lanham Act applies only to
commercial speech and does *not* apply to political speech. For the
following reasons, the Court disagrees.

RNC appears to collapse several distinct arguments into one general
contention that the Lanham Act does not apply to political speech. Each
distinct argument is addressed separately below.

First, contrary to RNC's assertions, courts have recognized that the
Lanham Act applies to noncommercial (i.e., political) *and* commercial
speech. *See, e.g.,* [*United We Stand America, Inc. v. United We Stand,
America New York, Inc.,* (2d Cir. 1997)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4833614207083058193);
[*MGM-Pathe Commns. Co. v. Pink Panther Patrol,* (S.D.N.Y.
1991)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15515381657632192294).
Indeed, the Act's purpose of reducing consumer confusion supports
application of the Act to political speech, where the consequences of
widespread confusion as to the source of such speech could be dire.
*See* [*United We Stand America, Inc.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4833614207083058193)
Thus, to the extent RNC's Motion is based on its theory that the Lanham
Act applies only to commercial speech, that theory is rejected.

Second, to the extent that RNC argues that Plaintiffs Lanham Act claim
must yield to important First Amendment concerns over protecting
political speech, such concerns are addressed in the Court's discussion
of the First Amendment and artistic relevance test in Section IV.2.
below.

Third, the mere fact that a defendant is engaged in political speech,
alone, does not bar a plaintiffs Lanham Act claim. *See* [*MGM-Pathe
Commns. Co*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15515381657632192294).
Thus, to the extent RNC's Motion is based on its theory that the mere
fact that Browne's Lanham Act claim is based on political speech bars
his claim as a matter of law, that theory is rejected.

Fourth, contrary to the implications of RNC's arguments, the Lanham
Act's reference to use "in commerce" does not require a plaintiff who
asserts a claim under Section 43(a)(1)(A) to show that the defendant
actually used the mark in commerce. [*United We Stand America, Inc*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4833614207083058193).
Rather, the Act's reference  to use "in commerce" actually
"reflects Congress's intent to legislate to the limits of its authority
under the Commerce Clause" to regulate interstate commerce. *Id.* The
interstate commerce jurisdictional predicate for the Lanham Act merely
requires a party to show that the defendant's conduct affects interstate
commerce, such as through diminishing the plaintiffs ability to control
use of the mark, thereby affecting the mark and its relationship to
interstate commerce. *See* [*Stauffer v. Exley,* (9th Cir. 1950)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15896581322123241159);
*see, e.g.,* [*Maier Brewing Co. v. Fleischmann Distilling Corp.,* (9th Cir. 1968)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3785793747909278971);
[*F.E.L. Publications, Ltd. v. National Conference of Catholic Bishops,*
(D.C.Ill. 1978)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4064965770617757909).
As such, the "scope of 'in commerce' as a jurisdictional predicate of
the Lanham Act is broad and has a sweeping reach." [*Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, Inc. v. Bucci,* (S.D.N.Y)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=2055558481777012858))
(citing [*Steele v. Bulova Watch Co*(S.Ct. 1952)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17007260925322207512)).

Thus, to the extent. RNC's Motion is based on its theory that Browne
cannot state a claim under the Lanham Act because he has not shown
actual use in commerce, that theory is rejected. Moreover, since RNC has
not actually argued that Plaintiffs claim fails to satisfy the
interstate commerce requirement, the Court will not address that issue
at this time.

#### *2. The First Amendment and Artistic Relevance Test*

RNC also contends that Plaintiff cannot state a claim under the Lanham
Act because the Commercial is an expressive work and thus the claim is
barred under the First Amendment and artistic relevance test. For the
following reasons, the Court disagrees.

In the Ninth Circuit, a Lanham Act claim based on use of a mark in an
artistic work is analyzed under the Second Circuit's *Rogers* artistic
relevance test, which was developed to address the competing interests
of the First Amendment's protection of artistic works and trademark
protection. *See* [*Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.,* (9th
Cir. 2002)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4174039731032587001).
Under this test, "[a]n artistic work's use of a trademark that otherwise
would violate the Lanham Act is not actionable [1] 'unless the use of
the mark has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever,
or, [2] if it has some artistic relevance, unless it explicitly misleads
as to the source or content of the work.'" [*E.S.S. Entm't 2000, Inc. v.
Rock Star Videos, Inc.* (9th
Cir. 2008)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6229102239124683155)
(citing [*MCA Records, Inc.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4174039731032587001)).

Here, the Court finds that RNC has not established that the First
Amendment and artistic relevance test bar Plaintiffs Lanham Act claim at
this time. First, RNC has not established that the Commercial is an
artistic work, requiring application of the artistic relevance test.
Second, RNC has not shown that the First Amendment and artistic
relevance test bar Browne's claim merely because the Commercial is
noncommercial, political speech. In fact, courts that have applied the
Lanham Act to noncommercial and political speech have implicitly
rejected the theory that claims based on such speech are barred, as a
matter of law, based on the First Amendment and artistic relevance test.
*See, e.g.,* [*MGM-Pathe Commns. Co.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15515381657632192294);
*see generally* [*United We Stand America, Inc*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4833614207083058193).
Finally, it appears that, in light of the Court's limited inquiry on a
12(b)(6) motion, the Court would have difficulty applying the artistic
relevance test at this time.

Thus, the Court finds that RNC has not established that Plaintiff's
Lanham Act claim is barred by the First Amendment and artistic relevance
test at this time and  rejects RNC's contention that the
Court should dismiss this claim on that basis.

#### *3. Likelihood of Confusion*

RNC also contends that Plaintiff cannot state a claim under the Lanham
Act because the Commercial clearly identifies its source as ORP, so
there is no likelihood of confusion as to its origin. For the following
reasons, the Court disagrees.

The Ninth Circuit considers the following factors, known as *Sleekcraft*
factors, in determining whether likelihood of confusion exists (1)
strength of the mark, (2) proximity or relatedness of the goods, (3)
similarity of the marks, (4) evidence of actual confusion, (5) marketing
channels used, (6) degree of care customers are likely to exercise in
purchasing the goods, (7) defendant's intent in selecting the mark, and
(8) likelihood of expansion into other markets. [*KP Permanent Make-Up,
Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.*(9th
Cir. 2005)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1804350555375013920).

Here, the Court finds that RNC has not established, at this time, that
Plaintiff cannot show likelihood of confusion. RNC's contention that the
Commercial clearly identifies its source as ORP, alone, does not show
that a consumer could not possibly be confused as to whether Browne
endorsed Senator McCain, RNC, or ORP. Moreover, RNC has failed to
address all of the *Sleekcraft* factors and whether they weigh against
likelihood of confusion. Without the parties' arguments as to these
factors, the Court is unable to thoroughly analyze likelihood of
confusion at this time.

Thus, the Court finds that RNC has not established that Plaintiff cannot
show likelihood of confusion at this time and rejects RNC's contention
that the Court should dismiss this claim on that basis.

The Court accordingly DENIES RNC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs Lanham
Act claim.

### V. *CONCLUSION*

In light of the foregoing, the Court DENIES RNC's Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiff's claims for Copyright Infringement, Vicarious Copyright
Infringement, and Violation of the Lanham Act. The Court addresses RNC's
grounds for dismissal of Plaintiffs California Common Law Right of
Publicity claim in its Order Re RNC's Special Motion to Strike.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., District Judge.

On December 22, 2011, 
Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. ("Louis Vuitton") 
filed a  complaint
against Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. ("Warner Bros."), 
focusing on Warner Bros.' 
use of a travel bag in the film "The Hangover: Part II"
that allegedly infringes upon Louis Vuitton's trademarks. 
Plaintiff's complaint asserts three claims for relief: 

1. false designation of origin/unfair competition in violation of ยง 43(a) of the Lanham Act; 
2. common law unfair competition; and 
3. trademark dilution in violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law 360-*l.* 

On March 14, 2012, 
defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
with prejudice for failure to state a claim
upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). 
The court has fully considered the parties' arguments, and for the reasons
set forth below, defendant's motion is granted.

### BACKGROUND

Louis Vuitton is one of the premier luxury fashion houses in the world,
renowned for, among other things, its high-quality luggage, trunks, and
handbags.  Louis Vuitton's principle trademark is the
highly-distinctive and famous Toile Monogram. 
Registered in 1932, this trademark, along with its component marks
(collectively, the "LVM Marks"), are famous, distinctive, and
incontestable.&hellip; 

Louis Vuitton has invested millions of dollars and decades of time and
effort to create a global recognition that causes consumers to associate
the LVM Marks with high-quality, luxury goods emanating exclusively from
Louis Vuitton.&hellip; 

Warner Bros. is one of the oldest and most respected producers of motion
pictures and television shows in the country and the world. 
In the summer of 2011, 
Warner Bros. released "The Hangover: Part II" ("the Film"), 
the sequel to the 2009 hit bachelor-party-gone-awry-comedy "The Hangover." 
The Film has grossed roughly $580 million globally as of the date of the Complaint, becoming
the highest-gross R-rated comedy of all time and one of the highest
grossing movies in 2011. 

Diophy is a company that creates products which use a monogram design
that is a knock-off of the famous Toile Monogram (the "Knock-Off
Monogram Design").  The Diophy products bearing the
Knock-Off Monogram Design have been extensively distributed throughout
the United States, causing enormous harm to Louis Vuitton.  Despite the inferior quality of Diophy's products, demand for its
products bearing the Knock-Off Monogram Design remains high because they
are far less expensive than genuine Louis Vuitton products. (*Id.*)

#### A. The Airport Scene

As alleged in the complaint, 
in one early scene in the Film 
the "four main characters 
are in Los Angeles International Airport 
before a flight to Thailand 
for the character Stu's bachelor party and wedding." 

"As the characters are walking through the airport, 
a porter is pushing on a dolly 
what appears to be Louis Vuitton trunks, 
some hard-sided luggage, 
and two Louis Vuitton Keepall travel bags." 
Alan, one of the characters, is carrying what appears to be a
matching over-the-shoulder Louis Vuitton "Keepall" bag, 
but it is actually an infringing Diophy bag. 
Moments later, 
Alan is seen sitting on a bench in the airport lounge 
and places his bag (i.e., the Diophy bag) 
on the empty seat next to him. 
Stu, who is sitting in the chair to the other side of the bag, 
moves the bag so that Teddy, Stu's future brother-in-law, 
can sit down between him and Alan. 

Alan reacts by saying: 

> "Careful that is ... that is a Lewis Vuitton." 

No other reference to Louis Vuitton 
or the Diophy bag is made after this point.

After the movie was released in theaters, 
Louis Vuitton sent Warner Bros. 
a cease and desist letter 
noting its objection to the use of the Diophy bag in the Film. 
Despite being informed of its objection, on December 6, 2011, 
Warner Bros. released the Film in the United States on DVD and Blu-Ray. 
The complaint alleges that 
"many consumers believed the Diophy bag" 
used in the Film 
"was, in fact, a genuine Louis Vuitton," 
and that Louis Vuitton consented to Warner Bros. 
"misrepresentation" 
that the Diophy bag was a genuine Louis Vuitton product. 
Louis Vuitton claims that its harm has been "exacerbated 
by the prominent use of the aforementioned scenes 
and the LVM Marks in commercials and advertisements for the [F]ilm," 
and that Alan's "Lewis Vuitton" line 
has "become an oft-repeated and hallmark quote from the movie." 
Louis Vuitton attaches to the complaint, 
as Exhibit E, what it claims 
are "representative Internet references and blog excerpts"
demonstrating that consumers mistakenly believe 
that the Diophy bag is a genuine Louis Vuitton bag. 

#### B. The Present Motion

It is instructive to consider 
what this case is about and what it is not. 
Louis Vuitton does not object 
to Warner Bros.' unauthorized use of the LVM Marks 
or reference to the name Louis Vuitton in the Film. 
Nor does Louis Vuitton claim 
that Warner Bros. misled the public 
into believing that Louis Vuitton sponsored or was affiliated with the Film.
Rather, Louis Vuitton contends that Warner Bros. 
impermissibly used a third-party's bag 
that allegedly infringes on the LVM Marks. 
According to the complaint, 
"[b]y using the infringing Diophy [b]ag 
and affirmatively misrepresenting that it is a Louis Vuitton bag, 
the public is likely to be confused into believing
that the Diophy [b]ag is an authentic Louis Vuitton product and that
Louis Vuitton has sponsored and approved Warner Bros.' use and
misrepresentation of the infringing Diophy [b]ag as a genuine product of
Louis Vuitton in *The Hangover: Part II.*"  The complaint
further alleges that "Warner Bros.' use and misrepresentation of the
Diophy [b]ag bearing the Knock-Off Monogram Design as an authentic Louis
Vuitton bag is likely to blur the distinctiveness of the LVM Marks" and
"tarnish the LVM Marks by  associating Louis Vuitton with the poor
quality and shoddy reputation of the cheap products bearing the
Knock-Off Monogram Design."  On the basis of Warner
Bros.' use of the allegedly infringing Diophy bag in the Film, Louis
Vuitton asserts three causes of action: 

1. false designation of origin/unfair competition in violation of 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a), 
2. common law unfair competition, and 
3. trademark dilution in violation of New York General Business Law ยง 360. 

[The standards for ยง 43(a) claims of the Lanham Act and common law unfair competition claims "are almost indistinguishable." &hellip;  [*Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. v. Unger,* (S.D.N.Y.1998)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=305622687625915731); [*Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc.,* (S.D.N.Y.2008)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9787575094444941549) (noting that the elements of unfair competition "mirror" the Lanham Act, except that plaintiffs must additionally show bad faith on the state law claim)].

Warner Bros. now moves to dismiss the complaint in its entirety 
on the ground that its use of the Diophy bag in the Film is protected by the
First Amendment under the framework established by [*Rogers v.
Grimaldi,* (2d Cir.1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849).[^5]

### DISCUSSION

[ &hellip; ]

###  B. Lanham Act claim

To state a claim for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, in
addition to showing that it has a valid mark, the plaintiff must show
that the defendant's use of its mark is likely to cause "an appreciable
number of ordinarily prudent purchasers" "confusion as to the origin,
sponsorship, or approval" of the defendant's product.&hellip; Courts look to the eight
factor test first articulated in [*Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs.
Corp.,* (2d Cir.1961),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2293827617926067028)
to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion.
When applying these factors, courts should focus "on the ultimate
question of whether consumers are likely to be confused." &hellip; 

#### 1. *First Amendment*

In [*Rogers v.  Grimaldi*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849),
the Second Circuit held 
that the Lanham Act is inapplicable to "artistic works" 
as long as the defendant's use of the mark is 
(1) "artistically relevant" to the work and 
(2) not "explicitly misleading" 
as to the source or content of the work.

The court in *Rogers* applied this test to the use of a trademark in a movie title, but courts have extended it to the content of expressive works as well. [*Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ'g Group, Inc.* (2d Cir. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3543157455154245054) ("[T]he *Rogers* balancing approach is generally applicable to Lanham claims against works of artistic expression."); *see also* [*E.S.S.  Entm't 2000, Inc. v. Rock Star Videos, Inc.* (9th Cir.2008)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6229102239124683155) ("Rock Star Videos") ("[T]here is no principled reason why [the *Rogers* test] ought not also apply to the use of a trademark in the body of the work.") (citing [*Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods.* (9th Cir.2003)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7581792703482092445)). The parties do not dispute the application of *Rogers* to the content of a movie.]

Louis Vuitton does not dispute 
that Warner Bros. challenged use of the mark is noncommercial, 
placing it firmly within the purview of an "artistic work" 
under *Rogers.  See* [*Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson* (1952)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5628256980652867975) (holding that motion pictures are protected speech); *see also* [*United States v. United Foods, Inc.* (Sct. 2001)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=905607278793226675)
(defining "commercial speech" as "speech that does no more than propose
a commercial transaction").

Louis Vuitton objects to the present motion on the following grounds:

1. whether the use was "artistically relevant" is an issue of fact that requires discovery; 
2. the "explicitly misleading" prong is not limited to confusion as to the source or content of the defendant's work;
3. Warner Bros. is not afforded First Amendment protection for using an infringing product; and
4. Disposing this case on a motion to dismiss is otherwise inappropriate. 

#### *a. Artistic Relevance*

The threshold for "artistic relevance" is purposely low 
and will be satisfied unless the use 
"has *no* artistic relevance to the underlying work *whatsoever.*" 
[*Rogers,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849)
(emphasis added); 
*see also* [*Rock Star Videos, Inc.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6229102239124683155)
(holding that, under *Rogers,* "the level of relevance merely must be
above zero"); 
*Dillinger, LLC v. Elec. Arts Inc.* (S.D.Ind. June 16, 2011) 
("It is not the role of the Court 
to determine how meaningful the relationship
between a trademark and the content of a literary work must be;
consistent with *Rogers,* any connection whatsoever is enough."). 
The artistic relevance prong ensures 
that the defendant intended an artistic---i.e., noncommercial---
association with the plaintiff's mark, 
as opposed to one in which the defendant intends 
to associate with the mark to exploit the mark's popularity and good will. 
*See* [*Rogers*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849)
(finding that the defendant satisfied the artistic relevance prong where
its use of the trademark was "not arbitrarily chosen just to exploit the
publicity value of [the plaintiffs' mark] but instead ha[d] genuine
relevance to the film's story").

Warner Bros' use of the Diophy bag meets this low threshold. 
Alan's terse remark to Teddy to "Be careful!" 
because his bag "is a Lewis Vuitton" 
comes across as snobbish 
only because the public signifies Louis Vuitton---
to which the Diophy bag looks confusingly similar---
with luxury and a high society lifestyle. 
His remark also comes across as funny 
because he mispronounces the French "Louis"
like the English "Lewis," 
and ironic because he cannot correctly pronounce 
the brand name of one of his expensive possessions, 
adding to the image of Alan as a socially inept 
and comically misinformed character. 
This scene also introduces the comedic tension
between Alan and Teddy that appears throughout the Film.

Louis Vuitton contends 
that the Court cannot determine 
that the use of the Diophy bag was artistically relevant 
until after discovery.
Specifically, Louis Vuitton maintains 
that it should be able to review the script 
and depose the Film's creators 
to determine whether Warner Bros. 
intended to use an authentic Louis Vuitton bag or Diophy's knock-off bag.&hellip; However, the significance of the airport scene 
relies on Alan's bag---authentic or not---
looking like a Louis Vuitton bag. 
Louis Vuitton does not dispute this was Warner Bros.' intention, 
and therefore the discovery it seeks is irrelevant. 
The Court is satisfied that Warner Bros.' use of the Diophy bag 
(whether intentional or inadvertent) 
was intended to create an artistic association with Louis Vuitton, 
and there is no indication that its use was commercially motivated. 
*See* [*Rogers,* 875 F.2d at 1001](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849).

[In a footnote, the Court distinguished cases cited by Louis Vuitton, 
including [*Parks v. LaFace Records* Cir.2003)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11600086449229682086)
(finding that "reasonable persons could conclude that there is no
relationship of any kind between Rosa Park's name and the content of the
song," and noting that the "marketing power" of the song's title
"unquestionably enhanced the song's potential sale to the consuming
public").]

Accordingly, 
the Court concludes that the use of the Diophy bag 
has some artistic relevance to the plot of the Film.

#### *b. Explicitly Misleading*

Since using the Diophy bag has some relevance to the Film, 
Warner Bros.' use of it is unprotected only if it 
"explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work." 
[*Rogers*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849).
The Second Circuit has explained that the relevant question 
is whether the defendant's use of the mark 
"is misleading in the sense that it 
induces members of the public to believe 
[the work] was prepared or otherwise authorized" by the plaintiff. 
[*Twin Peaks*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1671961186681268324).
The explicitly misleading determination "must be made, in the first instance, 
by application of the venerable *Polaroid* [likelihood of confusion] factors." *Id.* 
(citing [*Cliffs Notes*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3543157455154245054)).
Only a "particularly compelling" finding of likelihood of confusion can
overcome the First Amendment interests. *Id.*

*Rogers* and the cases adopting its holding 
have consistently framed the applicable standard 
in terms of confusion as to the defendant's artistic work. 
*See* [*Rogers*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849)
("The title 'Ginger and Fred' contains no explicit indication that
Rogers endorsed the *[defendant's] film* or had a role in producing
it.") (emphasis added) &hellip; *see also, e.g.,* [*Walking Mountain*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7581792703482092445)
("The photograph titles do not explicitly mislead as to [plaintiff]
Mattel's sponsorship of *[defendant's] works.*") (emphasis added);
[*Parks,* 329 F.3d at
459](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11600086449229682086)
("[T]he title "Rosa Parks" makes no explicit statement that the
*[defendant's] work* is about that person in any direct sense.")
(emphasis added); [*Westchester Media v. PRL USA Holdings, Inc.,* 214
F.3d 658, 668 (5th
Cir. 2000)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5449983782264273856)
(finding that consumers could plausibly believe "that [*defendant's
magazine*] is associated with [plaintiff's goods]") (emphasis added);
[*Twin Peaks,* 996 F.2d at
1379](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1671961186681268324)
("The question then is whether the title is misleading in the sense that
it induces members of the public to believe *[defendant's] Book* was
prepared or otherwise authorized by [the plaintiff].") (emphasis added);
[*Cliffs Notes,* 886 F.2d at
495](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3543157455154245054)
("[W]e do not believe that there is a likelihood that an ordinarily prudent
purchaser would think that *[defendant's book]* is actually a study
guide produced by appellee.") (emphasis added).&hellip; 

It is not a coincidence that courts frame the confusion in relation to
the defendant's artistic work, and not to someone else's. This narrow
construction of the Lanham Act accommodates the public's interest in
free expression by restricting its application to those situations that
present the greatest risk of consumer confusion: namely, when trademarks
are used to "dupe consumers into buying a product they mistakenly
believe is sponsored by the trademark owner." [*Rock Star Videos*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6229102239124683155)
(quoting [*Walking Mountain*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7581792703482092445)).
When this concern is present it will generally outweigh the public's
interest in free expression. *See* [*Rogers,* 875 F.2d at
1000](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849)
("If such explicit references [signifying endorsement] were used in a
title and were false as applied to the underlying work, the consumer's
interest in avoiding deception would warrant application of the Lanham
Act, even if the title had some artistic relevance to the work.").
However, if a trademark is not used, "in any direct sense," to designate
the source or sponsorship of the defendant's work, then "the consumer
interest in avoiding deception is too slight to warrant application of
the Lanham Act." [*Syler v. Woodruff* (S.D.N.Y. 2009)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2693087962354215527)(quoting [*Rogers,* 875 F.2d at
1000](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849));
*see also* 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition ยง 23:11.50
(4th ed.) ("[I]f the defendant does not use the accused designation as
defendant's own identifying trademark, then confusion will usually be
unlikely. Then there are not the requisite two similar marks confusing
the viewer into believing that the two marks identify a single
source.").

Louis Vuitton contends that the explicitly misleading prong is not
limited to confusion as to the source or content of the Film, but
rather, extends to confusion as to the source or content of a
third-party's goods. Curiously, Louis Vuitton makes this
argument without addressing the clear rule set forth in *Twin Peaks* and
instead relies on [*Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat
Cinema, Ltd.,* 604 F.2d 200, 205 (2d
Cir.1979),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11014508973363071529)
a decision whose First Amendment approach *Rogers* expressly declined to
follow and which has been criticized by other courts. [*Rogers,* 875
F.2d at 999 n.
4](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849);
*see* [*Parks,* 329 F.3d at
449-50](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11600086449229682086)
(discussing the problems that *Rogers* and other courts have found with
the *Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders* approach to First Amendment issues).
Notwithstanding the inapplicability of *Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders* to
noncommercial speech, like the speech at issue here, that case does not
stand for the proposition Louis Vuitton claims it does.

In *Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,* the Second Circuit affirmed a
preliminary injunction barring the defendants from exhibiting or
distributing a pornographic film that depicted the plaintiff's
trademarked cheerleader uniforms. [604 F.2d
200](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11014508973363071529).
There, the court rejected the defendants' argument that the Lanham Act
only prevents confusion as to the origin of the film, and ruled that the
Act also prevents confusion that "the mark's owner sponsored or
otherwise approved the use of the trademark." *Id.* at 205. Although
Louis Vuitton latches onto the "approved the use of the trademark"
language, when read in the context of the decision it is clear that the
court was referring to confusion that the mark's owner sponsored or
approved of the film, for this was the precise type of confusion the court
found actionable: "Plaintiff expects to establish on trial that the
public may associate it with defendants' movie and be confused into
believing that plaintiff sponsored the movie, provided some of the
actors, licensed defendants to use the uniform, or was in some other way
connected with the production." *Id.*

The other cases Louis Vuitton cites in support of this position are
similarly misplaced, because those cases merely cite to the same legal
principle that *Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders* stands for: namely, that
the Lanham Act recognizes confusion as to the sponsorship of the
defendant's product (in addition to confusion as to the source of it).
*See* [*Famous Horse Inc. v. 5th Avenue Photo Inc.* (2d Cir. 2010)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7455508940627654660)
(finding that the complaint adequately alleged confusion where the
defendant implied that plaintiff "was a satisfied customer" of the
defendant's goods and services); [*Pirone v. MacMillan* (2d
Cir. 1990)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8716702468310698178)
(agreeing with the district court that plaintiff "cannot possibly show
confusion as to source or sponsorship of the [defendant's] calendar")
(internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, neither of these cases
dealt with noncommercial speech.

Here, the complaint alleges two distinct theories of confusion: (1) that
consumers will be confused into believing that the Diophy bag is really
a genuine Louis Vuitton bag; and (2) that Louis Vuitton approved the use
of the Diophy bag in the Film. However, even drawing all reasonable
inferences in the light most favorable to Louis Vuitton, as the Court is
required to do, neither of these allegations involves confusion as to
Warner Bros.' artistic work. Specifically, Louis Vuitton does not allege
that Warner Bros. used the Diophy bag in order to mislead consumers into
believing that Louis Vuitton produced or endorsed the Film. Therefore,
the complaint fails to even allege the type of confusion that could
potentially overcome the *Rogers* protection.

Even if the Court assumes, *arguendo,* that Louis Vuitton has stated a
cognizable claim of confusion, its claim would fail anyway. The Second
Circuit in *Rogers* emphasized that when First Amendment values are
involved, courts should narrowly construe the Lanham Act and "weigh the
public interest in free expression against the public interest in
avoiding customer confusion." &hellip; As such, where an
expressive work is alleged to infringe a trademark, "the likelihood of
confusion must be *particularly compelling.*" [*Twin Peaks*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1671961186681268324)
(emphasis added); *see also* [*Westchester Media*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5449983782264273856).

The Court concludes that Louis Vuitton's allegations of confusion are
not plausible, let alone "particularly compelling." First, it is highly
unlikely that an appreciable number of people watching the Film would
even notice that Alan's bag is a knock-off. *Cf.* [*Gottlieb Dev. LLC v.
Paramount Pictures Corp.* (S.D.N.Y.2008) (Chin, J.)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7004261802942021108) (no confusion of plaintiff sponsoring defendant's film where "it would
be difficult for even a keen observer to pick out [plaintiff's]
trademark" since "it appears in the background of the scene" and
"occupies only a minute fraction [of] the frame for three segments
lasting approximately three seconds each"). In this regard, Louis
Vuitton is trying to have it both ways: arguing that the Diophy bags are
so similar as to create consumer confusion but at the same time so
obviously dissimilar that someone watching the Film would notice the
slightly different symbols used on the Diophy bag. Yet, the Diophy bag
appears on screen for no more than a few seconds at a time and for less
than thirty seconds in total, and when it is on screen, it is usually in
the background, out of focus, or partially obscured by other things.
Like the appearance of the plaintiff's mark in *Gottlieb,* the Court
finds that the difference between the authentic and knock-off bag is so
difficult to even notice, that a claim of confusion under the Lanham Act
"is simply not plausible." [*Gottlieb*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7004261802942021108).
Furthermore, Louis Vuitton's position assumes that viewers of the Film
would take seriously enough Alan's statements about designer handbags
(even about those he does not correctly pronounce) that they would
attribute his views to the company that produced the
Film. This assumption is hardly conceivable, and it does
not cross the line into the realm of plausibility. *See* [*Twombly*
(S.Ct. 1955)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18057384228100022643).
Lastly, Louis Vuitton is objecting to a statement made by a fictional
character in a fictional movie, which it characterizes as an affirmative
misrepresentation. However, this assumes that the fictional Alan
character knew that his bag was a knock-off; otherwise, he would simply
be (innocently) misinformed about the origin of his bag. For these
reasons, the Court concludes that the likelihood of confusion is at best
minimal, and when balanced against the First Amendment concerns
implicated here, it is not nearly significant enough to be considered
"particularly compelling." *See* [*Twin Peaks*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1671961186681268324).

Under the expansive view Louis Vuitton advances, Warner Bros. would be
liable โ not for identifying its own product with the LVM Marks โ but
for identifying the Diophy bag with the LVM Marks or, alternatively, for
implying that Louis Vuitton approved the use of the Diophy bag in the
Film. The public's interest in avoiding consumer confusion (assuming the
Lanham Act covers this type of confusion) is not so great as to overcome
the significant threats to free expression from holding Warner Bros.
liable for its noncommercial speech in this case. This is especially
true since the relevant confusion is caused by a third-party โ one with
whom Warner Bros. has no relationship whatsoever. Any
 confusion created by
Warner Bros. is at most indirect and thus "too slight to warrant
application of the Lanham Act." *See* [*Syler*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2693087962354215527) (quoting [*Rogers*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1704090655237798849)).

[This limitation on the reach of the Lanham Act is consistent with the text of ยง 43(a)(1)(A), which expressly requires the "confusion," "mistake," or "dece[ption]" to be "of [the defendant's] goods, services, or commercial activities," and with the core concern of trademark law, which is confusion related to purchasing decisions and not confusion generally.]

Louis Vuitton maintains that the *Rogers* test cannot be assessed on a
motion to dismiss. (Opp. at 14-18.) The Court disagrees. Although many
courts have considered the *Rogers* test on a summary judgment motion,
not on a motion to dismiss, the circuit has never stated that a court
cannot properly apply the *Rogers* test (or the likelihood of confusion
factors) on a motion to dismiss. In fact, the Second Circuit has
suggested that it would be appropriate "where the court is satisfied
that the products or marks are so dissimilar that no question of fact is
presented." &hellip; 

Here, there is no likelihood of confusion that viewers would believe
that the Diophy bag is a real Louis Vuitton bag just because a fictional
character made this claim in the context of a fictional movie. Neither
is there a likelihood of confusion that this statement would cause
viewers to believe that Louis Vuitton approved of Warner Bros.' use of
the Diophy bag. In a case such as this one, no amount of discovery will
tilt the scales in favor of the mark holder at the expense of the
public's right to free expression.

Therefore, even assuming, *arguendo,* that Louis Vuitton could state a
cognizable claim of confusion, Warner Bros.' use of the Diophy bag is
protected under *Rogers* because it has some artistic relevance to the
Film and is not explicitly misleading.

## C. State Law Claims

Louis Vuitton's pendant state law claim under New York's anti-dilution
statute and its common law claim of unfair competition are likewise
dismissed because they are based on the same permissible conduct as its
Lanham Act claim.&hellip; 

##  CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed above, defendant's motion to dismiss the
complaint is granted.

SO ORDERED.

##### Entertainment Lawyers On Fair Use

Watch this 6-minute YouTube clip of two entertainment lawyers discussing trademark and copyright issues.

[What Filmmakers Should Know About Featuring Logos & Trademarks In An Independent Movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64WGwD6VIhI)

A student sent me this YouTube and asked: 
"Hey, I thought you said that filmmakers should get logos and copyrighted material out of the shot! These lawyers say logos are no problem?"

Keep in mind these are two good lawyers getting paid well 
to solve rights issues that would not exist 
if the filmmakers had simply had the guy change his T-shirt. 
Then you would not need a lawyer on the phone with the E&O insurer, 
followed by negotiations over insurance contract language. 

I'm sure these are two fine lawyers
who pride themselves on solving rights issues 
AFTER the film has been shot 
and the filmmakers need to get insurance. 
(No mention about whether the filmmakers had to pay a premium 
over and above the usual 
to protect against the increased likelihood of litigation 
caused by an unnecessary rights issue 
and how many hours of legal work it took.)

Again, a price worth paying 
if you NEED that Star Wars logo or trademark 
because your hero dreams of Luke Skywalker
and models his life upon him, 
but if Star Wars means nothing to your film 
why put the logo in your shot 
and risk a completely unnecessary insurance or legal issue?

We know from class and from our book and from *Rogers v. Grimaldi* 
that you usually MAY use a trademark 
when it is artistically relevant to your work. 
So that's not news. 
(Doesn't mean another Ginger Rogers won't sue you anyway and lose.) 
The Disney example they use here is similar; 
if the filmmakers are making an undercover movie ABOUT Disney. 
That might make Disney and its trademark and logos artistically relevant. 
Then care should be taken 
to make sure that the audience is not confused 
about whether Disney made or sponsored the film. 

Same goes for fair use and copyright. 
As we discussed you can't stop somebody
from suing you for infringement, 
you simply assert the affirmative defense of fair use. 
But if you avoid using the copyrighted material in the first place, 
it's one less thing to worry about 
and one less issue for insurers or distributors 
who want to buy your film.
