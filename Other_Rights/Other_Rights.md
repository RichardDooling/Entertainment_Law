###Credits

Credits, or billing, is another way for artists and tradesman to receive
both recognition and compensation. Whether each name appears by itself
on the screen, in alphabetical order with others, or getting the
“top-billing” is considered and contracted for by agents and,
ultimately, unions. Conversely, whether someone wants to denounce credit
for a piece also has formal proceedings. Whether the person wants to
take credit, or doesn’t, can be vitally important. These billings can
do more than just give credit, they can also be used to bolster the star
power in movies or lend name recognition and attract attention for the piece.
Consider the co-director Massimo Toisi in the Oscar winning *Il Postino*,
who played absolutely no role in the direction of the American version
of the file. Yet he was credited because of his high status in Italian
film which helped secure the necessary financing and distribution
arrangements for the film.

The history of credits has evolved with the entertainment industry
itself. Silent films had no credits, only the name of the picture and
the production company. When performers became more widely known, studios
saw the benefits of publicizing or crediting their actors, which in turn
gave the artist more leverage to demand more money. Closing credits gave
a way for actors and artists to give a sort of final bow at the end of
the film. Of course the impact of these credits may have also lessened
some as film has evolved. Films now can have hundreds of credits by both 
[“above the line” and “below the line”](https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/glossary/) contributors including all kinds of personal involvement; including a
bee wrangler in *Fried Green Tomatoes* and a moth wrangler and stylist in
the *The Silence of the Lambs*. Of course the principle basis for negotiating artistic credits are labor agreements with the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild of America, the Directors Guild, and the American Federal of 
Musicians representing  those “above the line” movie contributors. 

This billing is an important contractual consideration. As far back as
1937, the courts have recognized the role of performance contracts.
Author Smith sold his story “Cruise to Nowhere” to Paramount
Productions, Inc., in April 29, 1933, for $2,500 in exchange for
“announcing on the film…it is based upon or adapted from a story
written by the Author…” for any of the same or similar title or story.
In 1945 Paramount began exhibiting a movie entitled *We’re Not Dressing*
and did not announce that it was based upon, or adapted from, the
story written by Smith. The jury agreed and the Ninth Circuit affirmed:

> We do not believe the evidence is subject to the charge of
> uncertainty. Smith testified that he and another
> writer collaborated in writing a story and sold it without screen
> credit for $10,000, which the two writers divided. Smith's story
> was sold for $2,500, but under a contract that required that he be
> given screen credit. From these figures, the jury might easily compute
> the advertising value of the screen credit. He also testified that he
> received screen credit for a play; that prior thereto his salary was
> $250 per week; and that afterward he received $350 per week at one
> time, and $500 per week for a period of two weeks, due to the screen
> credit he had received. That evidence is, if believed, likewise
> sufficient as a gauge for the measure of the damages.
>
> The judgment is affirmed.

[*Paramount Productions, Inc. v. Smith*, 91 F.2d 863, 866-67 (9th Cir.
1937).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Paramount+Productions,+Inc.+v.+Smith,+91+F.2d+863&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&case=6698459504294834305&scilh=0)

But along with the final bow and recognition, the final credits allow
for another creative outlet. Consider some of these notable movie
credits:

- Moose trained to mix concrete and sign complicated insurance forms by
Jurgen Wigg.
  - [Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)](https://youtu.be/5KYm1UpXiq0?t=1m45s)
- Ms. Streisand’s clothes from … her closet
  - A Star is Born (1976)
- Worst Boy – Adolph Hitler
  - Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)
- The Voice – HIMSELF
  - Field of Dreams (1989)

The Monty Python crew may have kept people in their seats to find out
what additional roles that Moose would play and today bloopers and outtakes
are often added to the final credits. Would you protest if you thought
you were receiving top billing and your name was the small print that no
one focuses on during the hilarious [Jason
Bateman outtakes](https://youtu.be/R3L2VacZGPQ)? Every alteration is
negotiated with money and recognition always being the motivating
factors. Truly, “in a town where ego, bravado and the manipulation of
truth create a relentless, prickly war of one-upmanship, questions of
name placement carry almost life-or-death importance.” Nick Madigan.

Who do you think might be irate to watch the introductory credits and see
“A file *by* Rob Reiner”? Such a [possessory credit](https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0402-Feb-2004/Possessory-Credit-Timeline.aspx) has been used
in Hollywood all the way back to 1915 and used by directors such as Frank
Capra and Alfred Hitchcock. But what is a possessory credit saying? That
Rob Reiner is solely responsible for the film? What about the actors who
played the parts? What about the tradesman who made every scene in the
film? What about the editor who actually put the film together? The
writer’s certainly find these possessory credits by directors
objectionable, trying (unsuccessfully) in 1994-1995 to prohibit anyone
other than a writer from receiving possessory credit. According to the
[Director’s Guild of America](https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0402-Feb-2004/Possessory-Credit-Timeline.aspx),
everyone involved in a motion picture is eligible to seek such a credit.
These negotiations, contracts and remedial procedures are almost
entirely dictated by the unions. Consider the [Producers Guild of America
Code of Credits](www.producersguild.org/?page=code_of_credits), even adding an additional recognition of The Producer’s Mark.

Billing considerations can also change throughout a process, especially
in a television show that may be changing on a continuous basis. Highly
regarded actor William Smithers brought an action against MGM when he
did not receive the billing in his contract after his character was
completely written out of the television show “Executive Suite." After
refusing to accept his lower credit, MGM threatened him with not
working with him on future projects. The jury found for Smithers and
damages in the amount of $500,000 for breach of contract, $300,000 for
breach of contract on covenant of good faith and fair dealing, $200,000
for fraud damages for never intending to give Smithers the billing he
contracted for, and $2 milling in punitive damages which the judge
adjusted to $1 million.

While many are vying to get the most credit and exposure they can, what
if an artist doesn’t want to take credit? Both Stephen Kind and Alan
Smithee have been in such a situation. King became “outraged” upon
seeing, without notice, the 1992 movie advertised as “Stephen King’s The
Lawnmower Man.”

MINER, Circuit Judge:

Defendants-appellants, Allied Vision, Ltd. and New Line Cinema
Corporation, appeal from an order of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (Motley, J.) granting a
preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiff-appellee Stephen
King in connection with King's claims under the Lanham Act and New York
law. King contended that Allied and New Line falsely designated him as
the originator of the motion picture "The Lawnmower Man," which was
produced by Allied and distributed in North America by New Line. The
injunction, which prohibits any use of King's name "on or in connection
with" the movie, encompasses two forms of credit to which King objected:
(i) a possessory credit, describing the movie as "Stephen King's The
Lawnmower Man," and (ii) a "based upon" credit, representing that the
movie is "based upon" a short story by King. For the reasons that
follow, we affirm the district court's order to the extent that it
prohibits use of the possessory credit, but reverse the order to the
extent that it prohibits use of the "based upon" credit.

**BACKGROUND**

In 1970, King wrote a short story entitled "The Lawnmower Man" (the
"Short Story"). In 1978, King assigned to Great Fantastic Picture
Corporation the motion picture and television rights for the Short
Story. The assignment agreement, which provided that it was to be
governed by the  laws of England, allowed the assignee the "exclusive
right to deal with the Short Story as it may think fit,"
including the rights

(i) to write film treatments and scripts and other dialogue versions
of all descriptions of the Short Story and at all times to add
to,take from, use, alter, adapt . . . and change the
Short Story and the title, characters, plot, theme,
dialogue, sequences and situations thereof. . . 

(ii) to make or produce films of all kinds . . . incorporating or based
upon the Short Story or any part or parts thereof or any adaptation
thereof.

In return, King received an interest in the profits of "each" film
"based upon" the Short Story.

In February 1990, Great Fantastic transferred its rights under the
assignment agreement to Allied. In
May 1990, Allied commissioned a screenplay for a feature-length film
entitled "The Lawnmower Man." By
February 1991, Allied began to market the forthcoming movie by placing
advertisements in trade magazines and journals. The picture generally
was described as "Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man," and as "based upon"
a short story by King. Actual filming of the movie  began in May 1991.
About one month later, Allied, through its United States subsidiary,
licensed New Line to distribute the movie in North America. The licensing
agreement was concluded in California, and a press release announcing
the distribution deal was issued from that state as well. New Line
initially paid $250,000 for the distribution rights, with an
additional $2.25 million to be paid thereafter.

King learned of the forthcoming movie in early October 1991, from an
article in a film magazine. He then contacted Rand Holston, an agent
handling King's film rights, in an attempt to gather information about
the film; asked Chuck Verrill, his literary agent, to obtain a "rough
cut" of the movie; and instructed Jay Kramer, his lawyer, to inform
Allied that King did not like the idea of a possessory credit (a form of
credit apparently portended by the article).

By letter dated October 9, 1991, Kramer advised Allied that King "did
not want" a possessory credit to appear on the film. Kramer also
requested a copy of the movie and the tentative movie credits King was
to receive. In another letter to Allied dated October 21, 1991--written
after Kramer secured a copy of the movie's screenplay--Kramer advised
that "we emphatically object" to the possessory credit contained in the
screenplay, and noted that he had yet to receive a copy of the tentative
credits.

On March 3, 1992--four days or so before release of the movie in
theaters--King viewed a copy of the movie in a screening arranged by
Allied and New Line.

The film and advertising seen by King contained both possessory and
"based upon" credits. On the evening of March 3, after viewing the film,
King wrote to Holston:

>I think The Lawnmower Man is really an extraordinary piece of work, at
least visually, and the core of my story, such as it is, is in the
movie. I think it is going to be very successful and I want to get out
of the way. I want you to make clear to the trolls at New Line
Pictures that I am unhappy with them, but I am shelving* any ideas of
taking out ads in the trades or trying to obtain an injunction to stop
New Line from advertising or exploiting the picture. I would like to
talk to you late this week or early next about doing some brief
interviews which will make my lack of involvement clear, but for the
time being, I am just going to step back and shut up.

>*At least for the time being.

In a March 23, 1992 letter, Kramer again advised Allied of King's "long
standing objection" to the possessory credit, and also took note of "the
apparent failure of Allied to inform New Line of Mr. King's
objection until the movie was about to be released." However, no
objection to the "based upon" credit ever was registered until May 20,
1992. From March through May 1992, New Line expended another $2.5
million in promotion and entered into certain hotel movie and television
commitments, as well as home video arrangements.

King initiated the instant suit on May 28, 1992, seeking damages as well
as injunctive relief. He claimed that the possessory and "based upon"
credits violated section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, see 15 U.S.C. §
1125(a), as well as the New York common law of unfair competition and
contracts, the New York General Business Law, and the New York Civil
Rights Law. A motion for preliminary injunction was made on June 3, and
a hearing was held on June 29.

The district court agreed with King on all of his claims and granted the
injunction on July 2, concluding that the possessory credit was false on
its face, that the "based upon" credit was misleading, and that the
irreparable harm element of a preliminary injunction action had been
satisfied. The equitable defenses of laches, estoppel and waiver
interposed by Allied and New Line were rejected.

The injunction prohibited use of King's name "on or in connection with"
the motion picture, and by its terms encompassed both the possessory and
"based upon" credits The injunction applied to distribution of the film
by Allied abroad as well as by New Line in North America, either in
theaters or on videocassette or on television. We granted appellants'
application for a stay pending this expedited appeal, but conditioned
the stay upon suspension of use of the possessory credit. At oral
argument counsel for New Line informed us that the videocassettes of the
movie now in circulation contain only the "based upon" credit.

**DISCUSSION**

**I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits**

The district court correctly noted that a false reference to the origin
of a work, or a reference which, while not literally false, is
misleading or likely to confuse, may form the basis of a claim under
section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1988)
(prohibiting use in commerce of "any false designation  of origin, false
or misleading description of fact,   or false or misleading
representation of fact" which is "likely to cause confusion . . . or to
deceive as to affiliation, connection, or association"); Gilliam v.
American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 538 F.2d 14, 24-25 (2d Cir.
1976).

**A. The Possessory Credit** 

We perceive no error in the district court's conclusion that King is
likely to succeed on the merits of his objection to the possessory
credit. The district court was entirely entitled to conclude, from the
testimony at the preliminary injunction hearing, that a possessory
credit ordinarily is given to the producer, director or writer of the
film; and that the credit at a minimum refers to an individual who had
some involvement in, and/or gave approval to, the screenplay or movie
itself. In contrast to other films for which he has been given a
possessory credit, King had no involvement in, and gave no approval of,
"The Lawnmower Man" screenplay or movie.

Under the circumstances, therefore, the arguments advanced by Allied and
New Line as to why the possessory credit is not false--that the other
movie credits make clear that King was not the producer, director or
writer of the film, and that King has in the past received a possessory
credit where he merely approved in advance of the screenplay or
movie--do not alter the conclusion that King is likely to succeed on his
challenge to the possessory credit. Appellants also contend that King
offered no evidence of public confusion in relation to the possessory
credit. As will be detailed in our discussion of irreparable harm,
however, there was some such evidence offered.

In any event, as the district court recognized, no evidence of public
confusion is required where, as is the case with the possessory credit,
the attribution is false on its face. See *PPX Enterprises, Inc. v.
Audiofidelity Enterprises, Inc.*, 818 F.2d 266, 272 (2d Cir. 1987)
(citations omitted).

**B. The "Based Upon" Credit**

As the district court recognized, a "based upon" credit by definition
affords more "leeway" than a possessory credit. The district court
nevertheless concluded that the "based upon" credit at issue here is
misleading and likely to cause confusion to the public, reasoning in
essence that the "climactic scene from the Short Story is inserted
into  the film in a manner wholly unrelated to the Plot of the
film," and that the credit "grossly exaggerates" the relationship
between the Short Story and the film.

While particular findings of fact are subject to the clearly erroneous
standard of review, we have said that the weighing of factors in "the
ultimate determination of the likelihood of confusion is a legal issue
subject to de novo appellate review." *Hasbro, Inc. v. Lanard Toys, Ltd.*,
858 F.2d 70, 75-76 (2d Cir. 1988) (citations omitted) (Lanham Act trade
mark claim). We believe that in so heavily weighing the proportion of
the film attributable to the Short Story in the course of finding the
"based upon" credit to be misleading and confusing, the district court
applied a standard without sufficient support in the testimony and
applicable law.

John Breglio, an attorney of the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison specializing in entertainment law, testified as an
expert witness for King. Breglio opined that the term "based upon," in
the context of royalty obligations under King's assignment agreement,
was not identical to the term "based upon" in a movie credit. After
speaking  of a test of "substantial similarity" between the
literary work and movie, and opining that there was not substantial
similarity between the Short Story and the film, Breglio went on to
state that the industry standard for determining the meaning of a "based
upon" movie credit is very similar to that used by copyright lawyers in
examining issues of copyright infringement. Breglio further explained
that this standard involved looking "at the work as a whole and how much
protected material from the underlying work appears in the derivative
work." (emphasis added)

Indeed, in cases of alleged copyright infringement it has long been
appropriate to examine the quantitative and qualitative degree to which
the allegedly infringed work has been borrowed from, and not
simply the proportion of the allegedly infringing work that is made up
of the copyrighted material. *See Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises*, 471
U.S. 539, 565-66, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985) (citing
*Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp.*, 81 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir.) (L.
Hand, J.), cert. denied, 298 U.S. 669, 80 L. Ed. 1392, 56 S. Ct. 835
(1936)). Accordingly, the propriety of the "based  upon" credit
should have been evaluated with less emphasis on the proportion of the
film attributable to the Short Story, and with more emphasis on the
proportion, in quantitative and qualitative terms, of the Short Story
appearing in the film.

Where a movie draws in material respects from a literary work, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, a "based upon" credit should not be
viewed as misleading absent persuasive countervailing facts and
circumstances. Our concern is the possibility that under the district
court's apparent approach, substantially all of a literary work could be
taken for use in a film and, if unrelated ideas, themes and scenes are
tacked on or around the extracted work, a "based upon" credit would be
deemed misleading.

In the case before us, the apparent "core" of the ten page Short
Story--a scene in which a character called "the lawnmower man" uses
psychokinetic powers to chase another character through his house with a
running lawnmower and thereby kill him--is used in the movie. In both
the movie and the Short Story, the remains of the murdered man (who is
named Harold Parkette in both works) are found in the birdbath by the
police; the two police officers in both works have the same names and
engage in substantially similar dialogue. As King himself described it,
"the core of my story, such as it is, is in the movie." The red
lawnmower seen in the movie also appears to be as described in the Short
Story. A brief reference to the Pan mythology of the Short Story appears
in the movie as well; dialogue between Jobe and another character
includes a reference to "Pan pipes of the little people in the grass."

We recognize that several important and entertaining aspects of the
Short Story were not used in the film, and that conversely the film
contains a number of elements not to be found in the Short Story.
However, when the resemblances between the Short Story and the motion
picture at issue here are considered together, they establish to our
satisfaction that the movie draws in sufficiently material respects on
the Short Story in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.

Nor are there any persuasive countervailing facts or circumstances in
the record to lead us away from the conclusion that the "based upon"
credit is proper in this case. King himself apparently was not bothered
much (if at all) by the "based upon" credit, in marked contrast
to his sustained and strong objections to the possessory credit, until
shortly before he initiated this suit. He has not pointed us to evidence
in the record of industry or public perception of, or confusion over,
the "based upon" credit beyond the thoughts offered by Breglio.
Professor George Stade, Vice Chairman of the English Department at
Columbia University and King's other expert witness, did opine that,
despite similarities, the movie was not based upon the Short Story.
However, even Professor Stade indicated at one point in his testimony
that "substantial" portions of the Short Story appear in the film.

In *Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.*, 538 F.2d 14 (2d
Cir. 1976), we found a violation of section 43(a) by the ABC television
network, which had aired, under license from the BBC, the "Monty
Python's Flying Circus" programs of the British comedy group. Monty
Python's agreement with the BBC gave the comedy group substantial
control over any editing by the BBC. *See id.* at 17. However, ABC on its
own substantially edited the programs it aired under the BBC license, so
as to eliminate many thematically essential and humorous
portions of the original programs. *See id.* at 24-25 & n.12. King
suggests, in disputing the legitimacy of the "based upon" credit, that
Allied's treatment of the Short Story is analogous to ABC's editing in
Gilliam.

However, at issue in Gilliam were original Monty Python programs which
were edited by ABC and then rebroadcast as Monty Python's work. We
specifically noted that Monty Python was being "presented to the public
as the creator of a work not its own, and made subject to
criticism for work it has not done." *Id.* at 24 (quotation omitted).
While Gilliam certainly supports the view we have taken of the
possessory credit, the case is not very helpful in evaluating the
accuracy of a "based upon" credit, which by definition deals with
altered and derivative works.

It is undoubtedly the case that King's assignment agreement does not
permit Allied to use King's name fraudulently, and we express no view as
to the degree of overlap between the term "based upon" in the King
assignment agreement and the term "based upon" in a theatrical credit.
However, we do note that the agreement contemplates substantial
alterations to the Short Story, and even obligates Allied to give King
credit in the case of a film "based wholly or substantially upon" the
Short Story. We think that King would have cause to complain if he were
not afforded the "based upon" credit.

**II. Irreparable Harm**

As the district court observed, a presumption of irreparable harm arises
in Lanham Act cases once the plaintiff establishes likelihood of success
on a claim of literal falseness, as King has established with respect to
the possessory credit.
 
(The court then rejected Allieds arguments that this presumption was rebutted
by King's delay or because he enjoyed the movie)

**CONCLUSION**

The order of the district court granting a preliminary injunction is
affirmed to the extent it prohibits use of the possessory credit, but
reversed to the extent it prohibits use of a "based upon" credit.

Finally, who is the illusive director Alan Smithee? He takes credit for
a number of pictures including the television version of *Dune*, a
Hitchcock sequel *Birds II: Land’s End* and *Hellraiser: Bloodline*.
This director has a wide range of productions under his belt, but
Smithee is no person at all. Instead, he is a creation of the
Directors Guild of America to allow directors to take their names off
their work. It is often editing disputes that cause a director to disown
his work and the director must formally apply to the Guild to receive
permission to use the Smithee name.

KOZINSKI, Circuit Judge:

Director Michael Apted was unhappy with the way Tristar Pictures edited
his film, Thunderheart, for television. With the help of the
Directors Guild of America (DGA), Apted sought a pseudonym for the
director's credit, for as his name is so is he.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

**1**
 
**I**

Cinephiles believe the director is the true author of a film: It's
Coppola's Godfather, Spielberg's Schindler's List and Verhoeven's
Robocop. So too when things go badly: It's Coppola's One from the Heart,
Spielberg's Lost World and Verhoeven's Showgirls. With his reputation on
the line, Apted was concerned when he learned that Tristar would shorten
Thunderheart by nearly half an hour in order to show it on commercial
television. 2 Tristar asked Apted to help trim the movie from 118
minutes, its running time in theatres, down to 90 minutes (a two-hour
slot minus commercials). Apted refused and insisted that Thunderheart be
shown in its entirety. Tristar decided to proceed over Apted's objection
and hired an editor who made 270 separate cuts totaling 22 minutes, sped
up the credits to steal two more minutes, and compressed the rest of the
film electronically to gain another four. Apted then asked that his name
be taken off the edited picture, but Tristar refused. After an
arbitrator ruled in favor of Apted, Tristar brought a petition in state
court claiming that the arbitrator had overstepped his authority. The
DGA then removed the case to federal court, and the district court
upheld the award. Tristar appeals.

**II**

Apted's relationship with Tristar is governed by a collective bargaining
agreement (the Basic Agreement) negotiated between the studios and the
DGA. Two clauses of the agreement are relevant to this appeal. One of
them, section 8-211, governs claims by a director that he is entitled to
a pseudonym. In order to avail himself of this remedy, a director must
first persuade the Director's Council of the DGA that he is entitled to
a pseudonym. If the Council assents, the pseudonym question is presented
to a joint panel composed of two representatives from the studio and two
from the DGA. If a majority of the joint panel sides with the director,
the film's directing credit goes to a fictitious director, typically
"Alan Smithee." If not, the studio may continue to use the director's
name.

The second relevant provision is the Basic Agreement's arbitration
clause. Section 2-101 sets forth the arbitrator's jurisdiction, which
embraces the capacious range of "all grievances, disputes or
controversies over the interpretation or application" of the Basic
Agreement. The arbitrator's authority can be invoked under a normal
arbitration procedure, set forth in section 2-300 of the Basic
Agreement, or under an expedited arbitration procedure, found in section
2-400.

In this case, the Director's Council agreed with Apted and on July 7th
called for the convocation of a joint panel to consider whether Apted
was entitled to a pseudonym. As of July 12, 1995, however, just six days
before *Thunderheart* was scheduled to air, the joint panel had not yet
met. The DGA therefore called for expedited arbitration of 
the dispute under section 2-400. The arbitration took place two days
later.

The arbitrator did not rule on Apted's pseudonym claim, explaining that
this was a dispute "most appropriately" resolved by the joint panel. But
he agreed that Tristar's cuts were so severe as to breach Tristar's duty
of good faith and fair dealing set forth in section 7-1502 of the Basic
Agreement. As a result, the arbitrator made a conditional award: If the
joint panel did not grant Apted a pseudonym, Tristar would have to show
a disclaimer that reflected Apted's view of the edited version. 6 The
awarded disclaimer read:

>This film is not the version originally released. 22 minutes have been
cut out. The director, Michael Apted, believes this alteration changes
the narrative and characterization and is not associated with it. The
film has also been electronically speeded up. The director believes that
this alteration changes the pace of the performance and is not
associated with it.

This put Tristar in a box. If it used Apted's name, it would be forced
to air the disclaimer, which would make it look as if the film had been
butchered. If it used a pseudonym, it would lose the attraction of a
respected director. Tristar chose what it saw as the lesser of the two
evils, and when Thunderheart aired on Fox, sans disclaimer, it carried
the label "An Adam Smithy Film." (The record does not explain why Tristar switched from Alan Smithee to Adam Smithy. It could be that Alan is 
developing a reputation. See Thomas Goetz, *King of the Bs: Appreciating Alan Smithee*, Village Voice, Sept. 2, 1997, at 78 ("The best anyone in 
Hollywood has to say about director Alan Smithee is that he gets the job done.").

**III**

Tristar argues that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.
Under Tristar's reading of the Basic Agreement, all disputes concerning
the editing of a film are governed by the pseudonym clause, and the only
remedy available to a director unhappy with the studio's editing
decision is to seek a pseudonym. While the language of the arbitration
clause is very broad, Tristar argues, it should not be read so as to
render superfluous the more specific procedure in the pseudonym clause,
which is calibrated to resolve disputes about whether edits made to a
movie so change its character as to render it no longer the director's
work.

Tristar's argument is not without force. The pseudonym procedure does
contain a carefully negotiated mechanism for dealing with precisely the
type of dispute that arose between Apted and Tristar. Notably, the
procedure gives the studio considerable leverage in resisting a claim by
the director. Because the joint panel is made up of an equal number of
members nominated by the studio and the DGA, a director can only obtain
a pseudonym by persuading at least one member nominated by the studio; a
tie vote denies the director the pseudonym. By contrast, the studio has
no particular leverage for resisting a ruling by the arbitrator - other
than the inertial force of being the non-moving party. The pseudonym
clause also gives the director only one possible remedy - a pseudonym -
while (as we see in this case) the arbitrator can grant other types of
relief. Finally, the contract provides no standard for obtaining relief
from the joint council, while the arbitrator is limited to any ground
available under the terms of the contract and applicable principles of
contract law, such as breach of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing. Given these differences, it would seem almost foolish for a
director to avail himself of the pseudonym procedure rather than seeking
relief under the arbitration clause. Indeed, a director might proceed
under the pseudonym procedure and, if unhappy with the result, then seek
a separate remedy under the arbitration clause over the same issue.

Tristar also notes that the arbitrator himself saw a tension between the
broad sweep of the arbitration clause and the pseudonym 
procedure. He therefore found that arbitration was not the "most
appropriate way" to resolve a dispute over a pseudonym, noting that the
parties had established the pseudonym clause as the method for resolving
disputes of that sort. Seizing upon this concession by the arbitrator as
to the scope of his authority, Tristar argues that the pseudonym
provision carves out an area where even the expansive arbitration clause
does not reach. By making the arbitration award provisional upon whether
a pseudonym is granted, Tristar claims, the arbitrator impermissibly
tread upon ground he admitted he had no right to occupy.

Were we interpreting the Basic Agreement in the first instance, this
would be a difficult case, but we are not. We are reviewing the award of
an arbitrator who ruled on this issue and held that Tristar had violated
the implied promise of good faith and fair dealing contained in Article
7 of the Basic Agreement. Tristar's challenge to the arbitrator's
jurisdiction fails, not only because of the broad language of the
arbitration clause, but also because of Tristar's prior actions.
Although Tristar did suggest at the arbitration hearing that the
arbitrator had no authority to decide certain issues, it chose to argue
that the arbitrator lacked authority rather than simply refusing to come
to the table. In this manner, Tristar "by its conduct evinced
clearly its intent to allow the arbitrator to decide not only the merits
of the dispute but also the question of arbitrability." *George Day
Constr. Co. v. United Bhd. of Carpenters,* 722 F.2d 1471, 1475 (9th
Cir. 1984); see also *Ralph Andrews Prods., Inc. v. Writers Guild of
Am., West,* 938 F.2d 128, 130 (9th Cir. 1991) ("HN1 A party may not
voluntarily submit his claim to arbitration, await the outcome, and, if
the decision is unfavorable, then challenge the authority of the
arbitrator to act."). Instead of resting on its present contention that
the arbitrator could not grant Apted the relief he sought, Tristar put
on evidence of its good faith in editing the film, tacitly admitting
that it was plausible for the arbitrator to assume jurisdiction over the
dispute.

Tristar's complaint that the arbitrator effectively forced it to grant
Apted a pseudonym, thereby circumventing section 8-211 of the Basic
Agreement and impermissibly extending the limits of his jurisdiction,
also fails. HN2 Our review of the scope of an arbitrator's award is
extremely narrow: We may ask only "whether the arbitrator's solution can
be rationally derived from some plausible theory of the general
framework or intent of the agreement." *Desert Palace, Inc.* v. *Local
Joint Executive Bd. of Las Vegas,* 679 F.2d 789, 793 (9th Cir. 1982);
accord *Van Waters & Rogers, Inc.* v. *International Bhd. of Teamsters,*
56 F.3d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1995). The Basic Agreement gives the
arbitrator ample leeway in fashioning remedies: Section 2-501 empowers
the arbitrator "to require the studio to change or re-do any film
titles . . . or to order any other reasonable relief the Arbitrator
deems appropriate in the circumstances, whether relating to credit on
the screen or in advertising or any other arbitrable matter . . . ."
This clause invokes the rule that HN3 "where it is contemplated that the
arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he
finds, courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in
that respect." *United Paperworkers Int'l Union* v. *Misco, Inc.,* 484
U.S. 29, 38, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286, 108 S. Ct. 364 (1987). The arbitrator's
ruling that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing gives an
aggrieved director more remedies than just seeking a Smithee is not
completely implausible.

Tristar also seems to argue that the arbitrator abused whatever
authority he did have by making his award conditional on the actions of
the joint panel, effectively forcing Tristar to give Apted a pseudonym.
But the arbitrator was entitled to consider the possibility that his
remedy might be rendered redundant if the joint panel awarded a Smithee.
If the arbitrator had authority to order the disclaimer, he
surely had the lesser power of awarding the disclaimer only in the
absence of certain conditions. Further, we observe that the disclaimer
didn't take away the studio's right, arguably granted by section 7-509
of the Basic Agreement, to edit the film as it sees fit. It only
required Tristar to disclose Apted's view of the changes Tristar made to
his film.

Tristar finally argues that affirming this award will create a per se
rule prohibiting studios from editing movies for television. We are
unconvinced that a single award will have any such effect. Although
section 2-309 says that awards interpreting a term of the Basic
Agreement are binding on the DGA and the studio, it also instructs that
"in any subsequent arbitration . . . involving an interpretation of the
same term or terms of the Basic Agreement, the Arbitrator may
determine whether or not, as a result of the different combination of
facts, the prior arbitration award is relevant or determinative of the
issue in such subsequent arbitration." Furthermore, if the arbitrator's
decision was indeed so far removed from the spirit of the agreement, the
parties are free to renegotiate the governing rules to preclude such
awards in the future.

We are bound by the very deferential standard of review that we must
give arbitral decisions. HN4 "Courts . . . do not sit to hear claims of
factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in
reviewing decisions of lower courts. . . . That a court is convinced an arbitrator committed serious error does not suffice to overturn
his decision." *Misco,* 484 U.S. at 38. Regardless of whether this is
the solution that we would come up with through our own independent
interpretation of the Basic Agreement, we must abide by the arbitrator's
plausible interpretation of the agreement. (Citing no cases, Tristar 
also claims that the arbitrator's evidentiary rulings violated due 
process. We see no reason to depart from our usual
deference to the procedural rulings of arbitrators. See, e.g., *Pack
Concrete, Inc. v. Cunningham,* 866 F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir. 1989).)

AFFIRMED.

Moral rights are an integral part of copyright law and are meant to protect the actual authors of a work. This is a key distinction from the contractual rights that can be negotiated. The recognition of moral rights is one of the greatest international divides with America having very limited statutorily protected moral rights whereas civil law countries fully embrace moral rights which are generally inalienable, meaning they can be neither transferred nor relinquished altogether.

### Facts

Norman Granz, well-known promoter and producer of jazz concerts, 
had one of his concerts recorded featuring two popular pieces titled 
"How High The Moon" and "Lady Be Good." 

Granz LICENSED Herbert Harris a record producer to manufacture and sell recordings WITH THE CREDIT LINE “Presented by Norman Granz.”

Harris produced records, 
but he omitted 8 minutes of the original songs 
because the performances would not fit onto the 10-inch records Harris was using at the time.

Granz sued Harris for breach of contract since it was not necessarily a copyright violation because Harris has a LICENSE.

Question becomes: Do we need "moral rights" to protect Granz?

Court says no. A contract will suffice. The contract conveying the license said that Harris could sell the recordings but only if he used the legend: “Presented by Norman Granz.”

The court said that the contract IMPLIED a duty not to sell records which would make the legend "Presented by Norman Granz" a false designation by cutting 8 minutes out of the session Granz presented.

> Sale of the ten-inch abbreviated records was a breach of the contract . . . and [because] the harm to the plaintiff's reputation as an expert in the presentation of jazz concerts is irreparable, injunctive relief is appropriate.

### Excerpts from *Granz v. Harris*

SWAN, Chief Judge.

We are therefore faced with the question 
whether the manufacture and sale by the defendant 
of the abbreviated ten-inch records 
violated any right of the plaintiff. 
Disregarding for the moment the terms of the contract, 
we think that the purchaser of the master discs could lawfully
use them to produce the abbreviated record and could lawfully sell the
same provided he did not describe it as a recording of music presented
by the plaintiff. If he did so describe it, he would commit the tort of
unfair competition. But the contract required the defendant
to use the legend "Presented by Norman Granz," that is, to attribute to
him the musical content of the records offered for sale. This
contractual duty carries by implication, without the necessity of an
express prohibition, the duty not to sell records which make the
required legend a false representation. In our opinion, therefore, sale
of the ten-inch abbreviated records was a breach of the contract. No
specific damages were shown to have resulted. As such
damages are difficult to prove and the harm to the plaintiff's
reputation as an expert in the presentation of jazz concerts is
irreparable, injunctive relief is appropriate. Hence we
think the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction against having the
abbreviated ten-inch records attributed to him unless he waived his
right. As already noted the district court found that the album cover of
the shortened record was corrected "at the plaintiff's insistence," and
consequently the defendant was not "attributing to the plaintiff the
work of some one else." The only evidence we can discover to support the
theory of waiver is the following bit of testimony by the defendant who
was called as a witness by the plaintiff:

> "As soon as I have received the letter from his [Granz's] attorney,
> probably about a couple of weeks later or month later, I called in my
> attorney and he said, What is Norman Granz's complaint, and he said he wanted to
> see his attorney, and he said he did not like the arrangement, and
> that was the question discussed, change the cover."

What this testimony means is far from clear. Even if Granz's attorney
requested that the cover be corrected immediately and without waiting
for the case to come to trial, we are not satisfied that this would
necessarily operate as a waiver of Granz's right to an injunction, if
sale of the abbreviated records under the legend "Presented by Norman
Granz" constituted a breach of contract or the tort of unfair
competition, as we have found it did. Whether he intended to waive all
claims or whether that result would follow regardless of his intention
depends upon what was said and done in the negotiations regarding
correction of the cover. We think the case must be remanded for
additional evidence on this point and a finding as to what, if anything,
Granz did consent.&hellip; 

FRANK, Circuit Judge, (concurring).

I agree, of course, that, 
whether by way of contract or tort,
plaintiff (absent his consent to the contrary) 
is entitled to prevention of the publication, as his, 
of a garbled version of his uncopyrighted product. 
This is not novel doctrine: 
Byron obtained an injunction from an English court 
restraining the publication of a book 
purporting to contain his poems only, 
but which included some not of his authorship. 
American courts, too, have enforced such a right. 
Those courts have also enjoined the use by another
of the characteristics of an author of repute in such manner as to
deceive buyers into erroneously believing that they were buying a work
of that author. 
Those courts, moreover, have granted injunctive relief in these circumstances: 
An artist sells one of his works to the defendant 
who substantially changes it 
and then represents the altered matter to the public as that artist's product. 
Whether the work is copyrighted or not, 
the established rule is that, 
even if the contract with the artist 
expressly authorizes reasonable modifications
(e. g., where a novel or stage play is sold for adaptation as a movie),
it is an actionable wrong to hold out the artist as author of a version
which substantially departs from the original. 
Under the authorities, 
the defendant's conduct here, 
as my colleagues say, 
may also be considered a kind of "unfair competition" or "passing off." 
The irreparable harm, justifying an injunction,
becomes apparent when one thinks what would be the result 
if the collected speeches of Stalin 
were published under the name of Senator Robert Taft, 
or the poems of Ella Wheeler Wilcox as those of T. S. Eliot.

If, on the remand,
the evidence should favor the plaintiff, 
I think we should grant him further relief, i. e., 
an injunction against publication by the defendant 
of any truncated version of his work, 
even if it does not bear plaintiff's name. 
I would rest the grant of that relief on an interpretation of the contract.

Plaintiff, in asking for such relief, 
relied in part not on the contract 
but on the doctrine of artists' "moral right," 
a compendious label of a "bundle of rights" 
enforced in many "civil law" countries. 
Able legal thinkers, 
pointing out that American courts have already recognized 
a considerable number of the rights in that "bundle," 
have urged that our courts use the "moral right" symbol. 
Those thinkers note that the label "right of privacy" 
served to bring to the attention of our courts 
a common center of perspectives previously separated in the decisions,
and that the use of that label induced further novel and valuable
judicial perspectives.

To this suggestion there are these objections: 
(a) "Moral right" seems to indicate to some persons something not legal, 
something meta-legal. 
(b) The "moral right" doctrine, as applied in some countries, 
includes very extensive rights which courts in some American jurisdictions 
are not yet prepared to acknowledge; 
as a result, the phrase "moral right" 
seems to have frightened some of those courts to such an extent 
that they have unduly narrowed artists' rights.
(c) Finally, it is not always an unmitigated boon to devise and employ
such a common name. As we have said elsewhere: "A new
name, a novel label expressive of a new generalization, can have immense
consequences.&hellip; 

Without rejecting the doctrine of "moral right," I think that, in the
light of the foregoing, we should not rest decision on that doctrine
where, as here, it is not necessary to do so.

The British comedy group Monty Python sued ABC 
for violating copyright and damaging their artistic reputations 
by broadcasting drastically edited versions of their shows. 

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
that ABC had arguably engaged in "actionable mutilation" 
and banned further broadcasts by ABC. 
The Court said that the Lanham Act (Trademark) could provide protection in the United States similar to that provided by moral rights in Europe 
and that ABC had also probably infringed Monty Python's copyright. 
Monty Python's original license to the BBC did not include BBC's right 
to drastically edit the episodes, 
and BBC could convey no more rights to ABC than BBC owned.

Copyright aside, what are other property rights may be associated with works of art? What if I decide that almost nobody can afford a Picasso, so I buy one Picasso and cut it up into a thousand pieces so I can sell the pieces to interested parties. Can anybody stop me?  

##### Exclusive rights under VARA:

VARA grants the authors of certain works the following exclusive rights:

* right to claim authorship
* right to prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
* right to prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
* right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation

Additionally, authors of works of "recognized stature" may prohibit intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work. Exceptions to VARA require a waiver from the author in writing. To date, "recognized stature" has managed to elude a precise definition. VARA allows authors to waive their rights, something generally not permitted in France and many European countries whose laws were the originators of the moral rights of artists concept.

In most instances, the rights granted under VARA persist for the life of the author (or the last surviving author, for creators of joint works).

#### Covered works.

VARA provides its protection only to paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, still photographic images produced for exhibition only, and existing in single copies or in limited editions of 200 or fewer copies, signed and numbered by the artist. The requirements for protection do not implicate aesthetic taste or value.

* [Case on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13445605668854417212&q=dastar&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28)

Background summary:

Dastar released a low-priced video set called *World War II Campaigns in Europe (Campaigns)* which was made by shortening and remixing a public-domain television series based on President Dwight Eisenhower's book *Crusade in Europe*. The copyright for Eisenhower's book was assigned to Twentieth Century Fox. Dastar marketed the video set as its own product and Fox brought suit alleging [reverse passing off](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/R/ReversePassing-Off.aspx) of the product in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act regarding a previously copyrighted work that has fallen into public domain.

In this unanimous decision, Justice Scalia addressed what the term "origin" means in the Lanham Act as a baseline, thereby invoking a discussion of moral rights even though it wasn't directly at issue in the case...

Excerpts:

SCALIA, Justice

Thus, as it comes to us, the gravamen of respondents' claim is that, in marketing and selling Campaigns as its own product without acknowledging its nearly wholesale reliance on the Crusade television series, Dastar has made a "false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which . . . is likely to cause confusion . . . as to the origin . . . of his or her goods." See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 8, 11. That claim would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought some of New Line's Crusade videotapes and merely repackaged them as its own. Dastar's alleged wrongdoing, however, is vastly different: it took a creative work in the public domain--the Crusade television series--copied it, made modifications (arguably minor), and produced its very own series of videotapes. If "origin" refers only to the manufacturer or producer of the physical "goods" that are made available to the public (in this case the videotapes), Dastar was the origin. If, however, "origin" includes the creator of the underlying work that Dastar copied, then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of Dastar's product. At bottom, we must decide what § 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act means by the "origin" of "goods."

III

The dictionary definition of "origin" is "the fact or process of coming into being from a source," and "that from which anything primarily proceeds; source." Webster's New International Dictionary 1720-1721 (2d ed. 1949). And the dictionary definition of "goods" (as relevant here) is "[w]ares; merchandise." Id., at 1079. We think the most natural understanding of the "origin" of "goods"--the source of wares--is the producer of the tangible product sold in the marketplace, in this case the physical Campaigns videotape sold by Dastar. The concept might be stretched (as it was under the original version of § 43(a)) to the text of the note to include not only the actual producer, but also the trademark owner who commissioned or assumed responsibility for ("stood behind") production of the physical product. But as used in the Lanham Act, the phrase "origin of goods" is in our view incapable of connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas or communications that "goods" embody or contain. Such an extension would not only stretch the text, but it would be out of accord with the history and purpose of the Lanham Act and inconsistent with precedent.

Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits actions like trademark infringement that deceive consumers and impair a producer's goodwill. It forbids, for example, the Coca-Cola Company's passing off its product as Pepsi-Cola or reverse passing off Pepsi-Cola as its product. But the brand-loyal consumer who prefers the drink that the Coca-Cola Company or PepsiCo sells, while he believes that that company produced (or at least stands behind the production of) that product, surely does not necessarily believe that that company was the "origin" of the drink in the sense that it was the very first to devise the formula. The consumer who buys a branded product does not automatically assume that the brand-name company is the same entity that came up with the idea for the product, or designed the product--and typically does not care whether it is. The words of the Lanham Act should not be stretched to cover matters that are typically of no consequence to purchasers.

It could be argued, perhaps, that the reality of purchaser concern is different for what might be called a communicative product--one that is valued not primarily for its physical qualities, such as a hammer, but for the intellectual content that it conveys, such as a book or, as here, a video. The purchaser of a novel is interested not merely, if at all, in the identity of the producer of the physical tome (the publisher), but also, and indeed primarily, in the identity of the creator of the story it conveys (the author). And the author, of course, has at least as much interest in avoiding passing-off (or reverse passing-off) of his creation as does the publisher. For such a communicative product (the argument goes) "origin of goods" in § 43(a) must be deemed to include not merely the producer of the physical item (the publishing house Farrar, Straus and Giroux, or the video producer Dastar) but also the creator of the content that the physical item conveys (the author Tom Wolfe, or--assertedly--respondents).

The problem with this argument according special treatment to communicative products is that it causes the Lanham Act to conflict with the law of copyright, which addresses that subject specifically. The right to copy, and to copy without attribution, once a copyright has expired, like "the right to make [an article whose patent has expired]--including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried when patented--passes to the public." *Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.*, 376 U.S. 225, 230, 11 L. Ed. 2d 661, 84 S. Ct. 784, 1964 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 425 (1964); see also *Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.*, 305 U.S. 111, 121-122, 83 L. Ed. 73, 59 S. Ct. 109, 1939 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 850 (1938). "In general, unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item, it will be subject to copying." *TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.*, 532 U.S. 23, 29, 149 L. Ed. 2d 164, 121 S. Ct. 1255 (2001). The rights of a patentee or copyright holder are part of a "carefully crafted bargain," Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 150-151, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118, 109 S. Ct. 971 (1989), under which, once the patent or copyright monopoly has expired, the public may use the invention or work at will and without attribution. Thus, in construing the Lanham Act, we have been "careful to caution against misuse or over-extension" of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by patent or copyright. *TrafFix*, 532 U.S., at 29, 149 L Ed 2d 164, 121 S Ct 1255. "The Lanham Act," we have said, "does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity." *Id.*, at 34, 149 L Ed 2d 164, 121 S Ct 1255. Federal trademark law "has no necessary relation to invention or discovery," Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 94, 25 L. Ed. 550, 1879 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 619 (1879), but rather, by preventing competitors from copying "a source-identifying mark," "reduces the customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions," and "helps assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product," *Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.*, 514 U.S. 159, 163-164, 131 L. Ed. 2d 248, 115 S. Ct. 1300 (1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Assuming for the sake of argument that Dastar's representation of itself as the "Producer" of its videos amounted to a representation that it originated the creative work conveyed by the videos, allowing a cause of action under § 43(a) for that representation would create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public's "federal right to 'copy and to use,'" expired copyrights, *Bonito Boats, supra*, at 165, 103 L Ed 2d 118, 109 S Ct 971.

When Congress has wished to create such an addition to the law of copyright, it has done so with much more specificity than the Lanham Act's ambiguous use of "origin." The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, § 603(a), 104 Stat 5128, provides that the author of an artistic work "shall have the right . . . to claim authorship of that work." 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(1)(A) [17 USCS § 106A(a)(1)(A)]. That express right of attribution is carefully limited and focused: It attaches only to specified "works of visual art," § 101, is personal to the artist, §§ 106A(b) and (e), and endures only for "the life of the author,"  [35]  at § 106A(d)(1). Recognizing in § 43(a) a cause of action for misrepresentation of authorship of noncopyrighted works (visual or otherwise) would render these limitations superfluous. A statutory interpretation that renders another statute superfluous is of course to be avoided. E.g., *Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc.*, 486 U.S. 825, 837, and n.11, 100 L. Ed. 2d 836, 108 S. Ct. 2182 (1988).

Reading "origin" in § 43(a) to require attribution of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems. Without a copyrighted work as the basepoint, the word "origin" has no discernable limits. A video of the MGM film Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to Oscar Hammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which the film was based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which the musical was based), and to Prosper Merimee (who wrote the novel on which the opera was based). In many cases, figuring out who is in the line of "origin" would be no simple task. Indeed, in the present case it is far from clear that respondents have that status. Neither SFM nor New Line had anything to do with the production of the Crusade television series--they merely were licensed to distribute the video version. While Fox might have a claim to being in the line of origin, its involvement with the creation of the television series was limited at best. Time, Inc., was the principal if not the exclusive creator, albeit under arrangement with Fox. And of course it was neither Fox nor Time, Inc., that shot the film used in the Crusade television series. Rather, that footage came from the United States Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, the British Ministry of Information and War Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified "Newsreel Pool Cameramen." If anyone has a claim to being the original creator of the material used in both the Crusade television series and the Campaigns videotapes, it would be those groups, rather than Fox. We do not think the Lanham Act requires this search for the source of the Nile and all its tributaries.

Another practical difficulty of adopting a special definition of "origin" for communicative products is that it places the manufacturers of those products in a difficult position. On the one hand, they would face Lanham Act liability for failing to credit the creator of a work on which their lawful copies are based; and on the other hand they could face Lanham Act liability for crediting the creator if that should be regarded as implying the creator's "sponsorship or approval" of the copy, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) [15 USCS § 1125(a)(1)(A)]. In this case, for example, if Dastar had simply "copied [the television series] as Crusade in Europe and sold it as Crusade in Europe," without changing the title or packaging (including the original credits to Fox), it is hard to have confidence in respondents' assurance that they "would not be here on a Lanham Act cause of action," Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.

Finally, reading § 43(a) of the Lanham Act as creating a cause of action for, in effect, plagiarism--the use of otherwise unprotected works and inventions without attribution--would be hard to reconcile with our previous decisions. For example, in *Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc.*, 529 U.S. 205, 146 L. Ed. 2d 182, 120 S. Ct. 1339 (2000), we considered whether product-design trade dress can ever be inherently distinctive. Wal-Mart produced "knockoffs" of children's clothes designed and manufactured by Samara Brothers, containing only "minor modifications" of the original designs. *Id.*, at 208, 146 L Ed 2d 182, 120 S Ct 1339. We concluded that the designs could not be protected under § 43(a) without a showing that they had acquired "secondary meaning," *id.*, at 214, 146 L Ed 2d 182, 120 S Ct 1339, so that they "'identify the source of the product rather than the product itself,'" *id.*, at 211, 146 L Ed 2d 182, 120 S Ct 1339 (quoting *Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.*, 456 U.S. 844, 851, n. 11, 72 L. Ed. 2d 606, 102 S. Ct. 2182 (1982)). This carefully considered limitation would be entirely pointless if the "original" producer could turn around and pursue a reverse-passing-off claim under exactly the same provision of the Lanham Act. Samara would merely have had to argue that it was the "origin" of the designs that Wal-Mart was selling as its own line. It was not, because "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act referred to the producer of the clothes, and not the producer of the (potentially) copyrightable or patentable designs that the clothes embodied.

Similarly under respondents' theory, the "origin of goods" provision of § 43(a) would have supported the suit that we rejected in *Bonito Boats*, 489 U.S. 141, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118, 109 S. Ct. 971, where the defendants had used molds to duplicate the plaintiff's unpatented boat hulls (apparently without crediting the plaintiff). And it would have supported the suit we rejected in *TrafFix*, 532 U.S. 23, 149 L. Ed. 2d 164, 121 S. Ct. 1255: The plaintiff, whose patents on flexible road signs had expired, and who could not prevail on a trade-dress claim under § 43(a) because the features of the signs were functional, would have had a reverse-passing-off claim for unattributed copying of his design.

In sum, reading the phrase "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act in accordance with the Act's common-law foundations (which were not designed to protect originality or creativity), and in light of the copyright and patent laws (which were), we conclude that the phrase refers to the producer of the tangible goods that are offered for sale, and not to the author of any idea, concept, or communication embodied in those goods. Cf. 17 USC § 202 [17 USCS § 202] (distinguishing between a copyrighted work and "any material object in which the work is embodied"). To hold otherwise would be akin to finding that § 43(a) created a species of perpetual patent and copyright, which Congress may not do. See *Eldred v. Ashcroft*, 537 U.S. 186, 208, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683, 123 S. Ct. 769 (2003).

The creative talent of the sort that lay behind the Campaigns videos is not left without protection. The original film footage used in the Crusade television series could have been copyrighted, see 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(6) [17 USCS § 102(a)(6)], as was copyrighted (as a compilation) the Crusade television series, even though it included material from the public domain, see [38]  § 103(a). Had Fox renewed the copyright in the Crusade television series, it would have had an easy claim of copyright infringement. And respondents' contention that Campaigns infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower's book is still a live question on remand. If, moreover, the producer of a video that substantially copied the Crusade series were, in advertising or promotion, to give purchasers the impression that the video was quite different from that series, then one or more of the respondents might have a cause of action--not for reverse passing off under the "confusion . . . as to the origin" provision of § 43(a)(1)(A), but for misrepresentation under the "misrepresents the nature, characteristics [or] qualities" provision of § 43(a)(1)(B). For merely saying it is the producer of the video, however, no Lanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.

Because we conclude that Dastar was the "origin" of the products it sold as its own, respondents cannot prevail on their Lanham Act claim. We thus have no occasion to consider whether the Lanham Act permitted an award of double petitioner's profits. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
