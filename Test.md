I want to try: 
__javascript__
   
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
     if(arg) {
      $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
     }
    }
   
   
####nope, can't figure out java yet... 
   :confused: This should work...
   
   :confused: emojis aren't working...


##a task list looks awesome
- [x] figure out mark down
- [x] figure out java
- [x] doesn't look like it will allow checking the box by user
- [ ] so it just lists what is done....not *as* cool...  

Is *syntax highlighting* for the code searching spiders???
