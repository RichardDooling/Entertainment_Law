# First Amendment - Obscenity 

## Obscenity

Most easily described as "hard core pornography,"
obscenity gets its own category of speech 
historically unprotected by the First Amendment.
The word "obscenity" sounds positively antique in the Information Age, 
where pornography is widely available via the Internet, 
and obscenity prosecutions are as rare as new video cassette tapes.
But for several decades in the second half of the last century, 
the Supreme Court felt its way toward 
a working definition of [obscenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity#United_States_obscenity_law) 
by deciding, case-by-case, whether various films were obscene.

### Movie Day 

In [*The Brethren: Inside The Supreme Court (1979)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brethren_(book)), 
a 1979 book by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong,
the authors provide a "behind-the-scenes" account of the United States Supreme Court during Warren Burger's early years as Chief Justice of the United States, including the Court's struggles to formulate its obscenity doctrine.
As hundreds of obscenity cases made their way through the lower courts, 
some of the Justices and their clerks instituted ["movie day"](https://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/movie-day-at-the-supreme-court-or-i-know-it-when-i-see-it-a.html) at the United States Supreme Court, 
a weekly gathering at which the law clerks and the Justices sat down to eat popcorn and view porn films, such as *Vixen* and *Fanny Hill (Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure)*, for the cases awaiting decisions. 
Justice Hugo Black, who served from 1937 to 1971, always refused Movie Day by saying "if I want to go see that film, I should pay my money." Justice Black and Justice William Douglas, who served from 1939 to 1975, did not participate in movie day because they believed that whatever was in movies about sex between consenting adults was protected by the First Amendment. Justice Harlan, who by the end of his tenure was nearly blind, "watched the films from the first row, a few feet from the screen, able only to make out the general outlines. His clerk or another Justice would describe the action. 'By Jove,' Harlan would explain. 'Extraordinary.'" *The Brethren*

Justice Potter Stewart gave the most honest and memorable definition of obscenity in 
[*Jacobellis v. Ohio*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio) (1964):

> I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ("hard-core pornography"); and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But [I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it), and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.

###  Obscenity Versus Indecency

Students new to the First Amendment often expect that any definition of *obscenity* 
must include foul language or swear words, in the sense of, 
"then, the dastardly villain uttered an obscenity." 
But the f-word and its kin are better described as [*indecency*](https://www.fcc.gov/general/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity), another legal category of speech with imprecise boundaries, 
[as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines it](https://www.fcc.gov/general/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity).

As we'll see later, obscenity trials are almost pass&eacute; 
because of the advent of the Internet. 
The Internet finally allowed the porn industry to reach their customers 
without displaying their wares on movie marquees and in the magazine racks of 
gas stations, drug stores, and convenience stores. 
If grandma never catches even a glimpse of porn, 
then she never writes her congressman, 
even though the U.S. porn industry [generates over $10-$12 billion revenue in the US, and close to $100 billion globally](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/things-are-looking-americas-porn-industry-n289431)

Obscenity is still worth studying 
because it holds lessons 
in how legislatures try to pass laws against certain categories of speech, 
how courts interpret, uphold, or strike down those laws. 
If intellectual property is like oil waiting to gush forth and become valuable, 
then it's as if the government says: 
It's against the law for you to drill for certain kinds of speech, 
or make certain kinds of intellectual property. 

For decades in the second half of the last century, 
obscenity was defined by the United States Supreme Court's opinion in 
[*Miller v. Californial*][miller] (US 1973).
The obscenity in *Miller* were brochures containing graphic sexual images advertising pornography, 
and most modern obscenity cases involve videos depicting hard core pornography, 
but in the first half of the last century, 
the printed word alone was enough. 

Less than fifty years ago, in [*Kaplan v. California*][kaplan] (US 1973), 
the Supreme Court held that: 
"Obscene material in book form is not entitled to any First Amendment protection 
merely because it has no pictorial content."

And less than thirty years ago, 
at least one federal district court in Florida 
ruled that 2 Live Crew's "Nasty As They Wanna Be" 
was legally obscene, based not on any videos or images, 
but based on the lyrics.
In his ruling, the judge carefully describes and applies the Supreme Court's *Miller* test 
and concludes that 2 Live Crew's music is obscene.

## *Skyywalker Records, Inc. v. Navarro*

GONZALEZ, District Judge.

This is a case between two ancient enemies: Anything Goes and Enough Already.

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. observed in [*Schenck v. United
States* (US 1919),][schenck] that the First Amendment is not absolute and that it does not permit one
to yell "Fire" in a crowded theater. Today, this court decides whether
the First Amendment absolutely permits one to yell another "F" word
anywhere in the community when combined with graphic sexual
descriptions.

Two distinct and narrow issues are presented: whether the recording *As
Nasty As They Wanna Be* (*Nasty*) is legally obscene; and second, whether
the actions of the defendant Nicholas Navarro (Navarro), as Sheriff of
Broward County, Florida, imposed an unconstitutional prior restraint upon
the plaintiffs' right to free speech.

It is before the court following a trial on the merits held May 14 and
May 15, 1990. The court has considered the pleadings, exhibits, the
testimony of the witnesses, plus argument of able counsel. By the
stipulation of the parties, the trial record also includes all evidence
and argument presented at the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction hearing
held April 19, 1990.

### The Plaintiffs

The plaintiff Skyywalker Records, Inc. (Skyywalker) is a Florida
corporation headquartered in Miami, Florida. The plaintiffs Luther
Campbell, Mark Ross, David Hobbs, and Chris Wongwon, constitute the
group known as "2 Live Crew" whose recording, *As Nasty As They Wanna
Be,* is the subject of this lawsuit. Luther Campbell is also the
President, Secretary, sole shareholder, and sole director of Skyywalker.

The plaintiffs have brought this action under section 1983, Title 42 of
the United States Code, which provides a federal statutory remedy for
unlawful deprivations of federal rights including those liberties
guaranteed under the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs also
seek a declaration of their legal rights, under the Federal Declaratory
Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), and injunctive relief under section
2202(b) thereof. This court has previously denied the plaintiffs' motion
for a preliminary injunction by *ore tenus* order entered April 19,
1990. There is no prayer for money damages.

Because this is a civil action, the party with the burden of proof must
prevail by a preponderance of the evidence. On the issue of obscenity,
the defendant Navarro has the burden of proof. As to the prior restraint
claim, however, the plaintiffs have the burden to prove, beyond a
preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant's actions were
unconstitutional.

It must be emphasized at the outset that this decision does not
criminalize the plaintiffs' conduct, nor does it charge anyone with a
crime. That is a matter for the police and the criminal courts to
determine. Whether the plaintiffs are guilty of a crime can only be
decided if criminal charges are brought, a trial by jury conducted, and
all other due process requirements have been met. Whether *As Nasty as
They Wanna Be is criminally* obscene is left for the determination of
another court on another day.

### The Facts

The recording *As Nasty As They Wanna Be* was released to the public by
2 Live Crew in 1989. To date, public sales have totalled approximately
1.7 million copies. The recording is available in various formats
including phonograph records, cassette tapes, and compact discs. 2 Live
Crew has also produced a recording entitled *As Clean As They Wanna Be*
(*Clean*) which has sold approximately 250,000 copies. Although neither
party introduced *Clean* into evidence, it apparently contains the same
music as *Nasty* but without the explicit sexual lyrics.

In mid-February 1990, the Broward County Sheriff's office began an
investigation of the *Nasty* recording. The investigation began in
response to complaints by South Florida residents.

Broward County Deputy Sheriff Mark Wichner was assigned to the
case. On February 26, 1990, he traveled to Sound Warehouse, a Broward
County retail music store, and purchased a cassette tape copy of the
*Nasty* recording. The tape was purchased from an open display rack
marked "Rap Music", easily accessible to all of Sound Warehouse's
customers regardless of age.

Deputy Wichner listened to the *Nasty* recording, had six of the
eighteen songs transcribed, and prepared an affidavit detailing these
facts requesting that the Broward County Circuit Court find probable
cause that the *Nasty* recording was legally obscene. On February 28,
1990, Deputy Wichner submitted the affidavit, an attached transcript of
the six songs, and the tape cassette of the *Nasty* recording to the
duty judge of the Broward County Circuit Court, the Honorable Mel
Grossman. The communications between Deputy Wichner and Judge Grossman
were limited to the filing of the affidavit, transcript, and tape
cassette. Several days later, Judge Grossman's chambers contacted the
deputy and requested further information concerning the location in
Sound Warehouse of the *Nasty* recording and its accessibility to the
public. Deputy Wichner communicated that information to the judge.

On March 9, Judge Grossman issued an order after reviewing the *Nasty*
recording "in its entirety." The judge explicitly found probable cause
to believe this recording was obscene under section 847.011 of the
Florida Statutes and under applicable case law.

The Broward County Sheriff's office received and copied the order, and
distributed it county wide to retail establishments that might be
selling the *Nasty* recording. It decided to "warn the stores as a
matter of courtesy" rather than make an initial arrest because,
according to Deputy Wichner's testimony, such conduct would have been
overaggressive. The Sheriff's office has not opened any investigations
of other musical recordings because of the absence of citizen
complaints.

Thereafter, Deputy Wichner re-visited the store where he had purchased
the original recording plus another Sound Warehouse outlet and a store
called Uncle Sam's Records. On these visits, the deputy wore a jacket
marked "Broward County Sheriff" and displayed his badge in plain view.
He spoke with a manager in each of the three stores, provided them with
a copy of Judge Grossman's order, and told them, in a friendly
conversational tone, that they should refrain from selling the *Nasty*
recording. The managers were warned that further sales would result in
arrest and that if convicted, the penalty for selling to a minor was a
felony, and a misdemeanor if sold to an adult. Between fifteen and
twenty different Broward County stores were personally visited by the
Sheriff's office, and the evidence indicates that each of the visits was
conducted in the same manner as were Deputy Wichner's three stops.

The Sheriff's office warnings were very effective. Within days, all
retail stores in Broward County ceased offering the *Nasty* recording
for sale. Those stores not directly visited by deputy sheriffs pulled
the recording from their shelves after hearing about the visits from
television and radio reports. Some stores continued to sell the *Clean*
recording. *Nasty* was no longer sold even by stores having a policy of
specially marking the recording with a warning, and of not selling it to
minors. 2 Live Crew also includes a small statement on the front of the
paper insert to their recording, as follows: "WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE
CONTAINED".

The Broward County Sheriff's office took no further action because there
was no information that any store was selling the *Nasty* recording.

On March 16, 1990, the plaintiffs filed this action in federal district
court. On March 27, 1990, Sheriff Nicholas Navarro filed an *in rem*
proceeding in Broward County Circuit Court against the *Nasty* recording
seeking a judicial determination that it was obscene under state law.
*See Navarro v. The Recording "As Nasty As They Wanna Be",* case number
90-09324(12) (Reasbeck). There is no evidence  of the status of
the state case including whether a trial date has been set. No criminal
proceedings against either the recording or the group 2 Live Crew have
been instituted.

### Obscenity And The First Amendment

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that
"Congress shall make no law &hellip; abridging the freedom of speech." The
Fourteenth Amendment declares that "no State shall &hellip; deprive any
person of &hellip; liberty &hellip; without due process of law." It is now
well-established that this "liberty" 
includes the right to free speech. *Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,* 
*Miller v. California*. 
Hence, neither the federal nor the state governments may abridge this
Constitutional right.

The First Amendment is one of our most sacred liberties since freedom of
thought and speech are the key to the preservation of all other rights.
Free speech plays a critical role in furthering self-government, in
encouraging individual self-realization, and fostering society's search
for truth via exposure to a "marketplace of ideas."

To protect that sacred right, the judiciary carefully scrutinizes
government regulation to determine if such regulation impermissibly
infringes upon it. When legislative or executive action is directed at
the content of one's speech, it will pass judicial review only upon a
showing that the action is designed to further a compelling governmental
interest by narrowly drawn means necessary to achieve the end. 

The First Amendment's guaranty is not absolute, however. *See, e.g., Chaplinsky.*
Although the amendment is unconditional on its face, the fact that there
were accepted state limits on speech at the time it was ratified
indicates that the "phrasing of the First Amendment was not intended to
protect every utterance." 

This is certainly true about speech on sexual subjects.

Obscene speech has *no* protection under the First Amendment. 
The rationale is simple: the message conveyed by obscene speech is of
such slight social value that it is always outweighed by the compelling
interests of society, as manifested in the laws enacted by its elected
representatives. 

Sex has been called "a great and mysterious motive force in human life".
Because of its power, both federal and state governments have chosen to
regulate its abuse. For example, states have banned prostitution,
incest, rape, and other sexually related conduct. These prohibitions are
no different than a ban on obscenity. The distinction between
regulations of conduct and speech does not invalidate obscenity laws. As
noted in [*Miller v.  California*][miller],
"Sex and nudity many not be exploited without limit by films and
pictures exhibited or sold in places of public accomodation any more
than live sex and nudity can be exhibited or sold without limit in such
public places." 

The state may also have an important interest in protecting minors and
unwilling or sensitive adults from exposure to obscene materials. 
*See* [*Miller*][miller]. The plaintiffs attempt to diminish the state's interest by
relying upon language in [*Butler v. Michigan*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8098803622147894006)
(US 1957) that if materials that are only obscene as to minors are banned, a
state's statute would "reduce the adult population &hellip; to reading only
what is fit for children." This decision
only applies, however, to governmental regulations of materials which
are not obscene as to adult audiences. Certainly it is not improper for
a state to protect children from materials which are too lewd for even
adult consumption.

Words, including musical lyrics, are powerful. As noted in [*Paris Adult Theatre I*][paris]:

> If there is a well nigh universal belief that good books, plays, and
> art lift the spirit, improve the mind, enrich the human personality,
> and develop character, can we then say that a state legislature may
> not act on the corollary assumption that commerce in obscene books, or
> public exhibitions focused on obscene conduct, have a tendency to
> exert a corrupting and debasing impact leading to antisocial behavior?

Even though there is no Constitutional protection for obscenity and
there are potential governmental interests at stake, it does not
necessarily mean that obscene speech is illegal. Indeed, state
governments could legalize obscenity including use by consenting adults.

The government must first criminalize obscenity before it is outlawed.
Indeed, if there were no statutory bans enacted by the legislature,
courts would not have to decide what is and what is not obscene.

The Florida Legislature *has* acted, however. It has enacted a statutory
scheme outlawing obscenity. It is apparent that this legislation is
intended to regulate obscenity to the maximum extent allowed by the
Constitution of the United States. Florida Statutes,
tracks the language of the controlling case of [*Miller v.
California*][miller] in defining obscenity for purposes of the state ban. 

The Florida Legislature has enacted a comprehensive set of laws. The
primary provision &hellip; *criminalizes* the distribution, sale, or production of any
obscene thing including a "recording" which can be "transmuted into
auditory &hellip; representations." Subsection (2) similarly makes it a
*crime* for a person to knowingly have an obscene thing, including
musical recordings, in his possession. Other sections make it
*criminal* to transport obscenity into the state or to create, deliver,
or publish obscenity. There are several provisions which specifically
apply to child pornography. Finally, others prohibit obscene programming on cable television during promotional
periods and require ratings on video tapes rented and sold to the
public.

An argument underlying the plaintiffs' position is that the
obscenity or non-obscenity of any material should not be a concern of
the criminal law, but rather should be left to the free market of ideas.
Let each individual member of the public decide whether they wish to buy
the material. 2 Live Crew has labeled their work with an explicit
warning. They claim this label allows adults who would object to the
recording's contents to exercise the consumer's right of free choice to
not buy the product. To use the example of television, if the viewer
does not like what he sees on Channel X, he may switch to Channel Y or
turn off the set. In the case of obscene music, people who do not want
to listen to obscenity do not have to buy it.

This is the argument of those absolutists who believe *all speech,
regardless of its content,* is protected by the First Amendment. Such
individuals label all regulation of speech as "censorship" and
"paternalism". This absolutist view finds strength among those who
believe rugged individualism is a valued virtue, if not a protected
right that everyone should be permitted to "do their own thing."

This is a facially appealing argument. The problem is that it is not the
law.

Florida has declared obscenity to be a crime. To repeat, violation of
the laws against obscenity is as much against the law as assault, rape,
kidnapping, robbery, or any other form of behavior which the legislature
has declared criminal.

The absolutists and other members of the party of Anything Goes should
address their petitions to the Florida Legislature, not to this court.
If they are sincere let them say what they actually mean—Lets' Legalize
Obscenity!

To be redundant, obscenity is not a protected form of speech under the
U.S. Constitution, with or without voluntary labeling. *It is a crime.*
If the people of Florida, want to legalize obscenity, they have every
right to do so. It is much easier to criticize the law, however, than it
is to work to repeal it. As the Supreme Court stated in [*Paris Adult
Theatre I*][paris]:

> It is argued that individual "free will" must govern, even in
> activities beyond the protection of the First Amendment and other
> constitutional guarantees of privacy, and that government cannot
> legitimately impede an individual's desire to see or acquire obscene
> plays, movies, and books. We do indeed base our society on certain
> assumptions that people have the capacity for free choice. Most
> exercises of individual free choice—those in politics, religion, and
> expression of ideas—are explicitly protected by the Constitution.
> Totally unlimited play for free will, however, is not allowed in our
> or any other society &hellip;

> The States, of course, may follow &hellip; a "laissez-faire" policy and
> drop all controls on commercialized obscenity, if that is what they
> prefer, just as they can ignore consumer protection in the
> marketplace, but nothing in the Constitution *compels* the States to
> do so with regard to matters falling within state jurisdiction.

This court's role is merely to interpret the law to determine whether
the particular material is obscene. If the inquiry yields an affirmative
response, judicial review is limited to whether the means chosen to
implement the law are rationally related to the goal of the legislation.
It is not the role of this court to sit as a Super-Legislature to
second-guess whether the best possible law was passed. 
This court must also refrain from substituting its own choice of the
appropriate means to outlaw obscenity, for this is a matter of
legislative discretion subject only to the boundaries of the
Constitution and the conscience of the legislators. 
And if a statute only regulates unprotected obscenity, mere rationality
is sufficient to satisfy due process.

In an era where the law and society are rightfully concerned with the
rights of minorities, it should not be overlooked nor forgotten that
majorities also have rights.

 In our democratic form of government, citizens elect
representatives to protect their interests and promote their welfare.
State legislatures have the authority to exercise the governmental
police power which reaches all manner of human conduct. As already seen,
state regulation may reach some of the most intimate aspects of man's
existence including sex. 
When man enters into a society and becomes a member
thereof, he necessarily submits to its laws and thereby must give up the
unfettered liberty he would otherwise possess in his natural state.

In sum, if persons subscribe to the view that obscenity should be
legalized, they should take their petitions to Tallahassee, the Florida
capital, not to the steps of the U.S. courthouse.

The people of Florida have made obscenity a crime. Individuals are not
free to disobey or disregard the law. The law is not a smorgasbord where
people are free to pick and choose among which laws they will obey and
which they will reject. Neither is it a channel selector available to
every member of the public to use as they deem fit. As noted in the
Pattern Instructions of the Eleventh Circuit, jurors in deciding the
rights and liberties of their fellow citizens "must &hellip; 
follow the law whether &hellip; [they] agree with that law or not."

Men and women in good faith may agree or disagree as to whether
obscenity should be prohibited. They can argue that the obscenity
statutes should or should not be repealed. In the meantime, however, the
law must be obeyed and the Sheriff has a duty to enforce it. Indeed,
Florida's Legislature has mandated that all sheriffs in the state are to
"vigorously enforce" the obscenity laws. *See* FLA.STAT.ANN. §
847.011(9) (Supp.1990).

### The Miller v. California Test

In deciding whether a specific work is or is not obscene, the court must
apply the controlling test enunciated in [*Miller v. California*][miller]
To be obscene, there must be proof of all three of the following
factors: (1) the average person, applying contemporary community
standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the
prurient interest, (2) measured by contemporary community standards, the
work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct
specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (3) the work,
taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value. 

### The Relevant Community

Both the first and second elements of *Miller* require application of
"contemporary community standards." The issues of the size of the
appropriate community, its composition, and the view of the average
person in that group are all questions of fact to be decided by the
trier of fact, which is the court in this case. 

Both parties Apparently assumed that the relevant community was only
Broward County, Florida. Neither litigant presented any evidence to
support this assumption, which was apparently based upon the
jurisdiction of the Broward County Sheriff and the County lines.
However, the boundaries of the relevant community under *Miller* are a
matter for judicial, not legislative, determination. 

This court finds that in assessing whether this work is
obscene, the relevant community is the area of Palm Beach, Broward, and
Dade Counties. 

If the relevant community is Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach counties, the
next step is to determine the composition of the citizens of this area.
The court, as the finder of fact, must rely upon its own personal
knowledge as the parties failed to present evidence on this point. In a
word, this area is remarkable for its diversity. The three counties are
a mecca for both the very young and the very old. Because of the beachs
and the moderate year-round climate, this area includes young persons
establishing homes and older residents retiring to enjoy life under the
sun. There are both families and single individuals residing in the
communities. Generally, the counties are heterogeneous in terms of
religion, class, race, and gender.

### The Average Person Standard

The next inquiry is more difficult because this court must determine
what are the standards for determining prurient interest and patent
offensiveness in Palm Beach, Dade, and Broward Counties. The fact that
the state legislature has enacted laws prohibiting obscenity is
certainly relevant and entitled to great weight. The state's
anti-obscenity stance as a whole, however, is overinclusive because
other communities outside the three counties are included in the
majority who passed the legislation.

In determining the views of the "average person" in this area, the court
has *not* focused only on the views of the most tolerant or the most
sensitive individuals. The "average person" does not
necessarily represent any one segment of the community. It is a legal
concept whereby a single perspective is derived from the aggregation or
average of everyone's attitudes in the area including persons with
differing degrees of tolerance (community under *Miller* is made up of all adults in the area including
the most sensitive). The court has not considered minors in its
considerations because there was not sufficient evidence adduced at
trial that the music was targeted at such persons or that it actually
reached children.

This court finds that the relevant community standard reflects a *more*
tolerant view of obscene speech than would other communities within the
state. This finding of fact is based upon this court's personal
knowledge of the community. The undersigned judge has resided in Broward
County since 1958. As a practicing attorney, state prosecutor, state
circuit judge, and currently, a federal district judge, the undersigned
has traveled and worked in Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach. As a member of
the community, he has personal knowledge of this area's demographics,
culture, economics, and politics. He has attended public functions and
events in all three counties and is aware of the community's concerns as
reported in the media and by word of mouth. In almost fourteen years as
a state circuit judge, the undersigned gained personal knowledge of the
nature of obscenity in the community while viewing dozens, if not
hundreds of allegedly obscene films and other publications seized by law
enforcement.

The court does not adopt the plaintiffs' position that these three
counties can be labeled as "tolerant" per se as opposed to some degree
thereof. Neither the trier of fact's personal knowledge nor the
plaintiffs' evidence supports such a conclusion. The plaintiffs argue
that the lack of written complaints in the *Nasty* investigation file
created by the Broward Sheriff's office is evidence of a tolerant
community standard. While this fact is entitled to some weight, it is
far from significant. There may be many reasons why concerned citizens
have not complained. For example, the *Nasty* recording was not released
until 1989 and it takes time for even a popular musical release to reach
the public consciousness. Although the Sheriff has the duty to enforce
the obscenity laws regardless of community protest, Deputy Wichner's
explanation of why this particular album was singled out can reasonably
be linked to significant community discontent, whether communicated by
telephone calls, anonymous messages, or letters to the police.
Furthermore, the vast majority of complaints in the file, although not
exclusively from Broward County, were residents of the relevant
community.

Further, the plaintiffs' reliance upon the admission of other sexually
explicit works is also not entitled to great weight in determining
community standards. First, the Supreme Court has recognized that this
type of evidence does not even have to be considered even if the
comparable works have been found to be nonobscene. 
In this case, there is no evidence that the comparable materials are not
themselves obscene. More importantly, most of the materials are simply
irrelevant. This case involves the alleged obscenity of a musical
recording. Evidence of depictions of sexual conduct in pictures, moving
or still, is not substantially equivalent to musical lyrics.

The most comparable works introduced are the sexually explicit writings
in the various books and magazines, the audio tape entitled *Raw* by
Eddie Murphy, and the double cassette tape recording by Andrew Dice
Clay. All three of these works focus upon a verbal message analogous to
the format in the *Nasty* recording. The court does give these
particular works some weight.

The plaintiffs also raise several collateral arguments as to why this
court is allegedly unable to determine the community standards. They
claim that the defendant's  failure to introduce evidence at the
trial including expert testimony is fatal. The plaintiffs also allege
that this court's opinion will only reflect the personal opinion of the
undersigned judge, not the relevant community. They support this
argument by pointing to the court's alleged refusal to empanel a jury in
this case. [trial by jury arguments omitted].

The plaintiffs' claim that this court cannot decide this case without
expert testimony and the introduction of specific evidence on community
standards is also without merit. The law does not require expert
testimony in an obscenity case. The defendant introduced the *Nasty*
recording into evidence. As noted by the Supreme Court in *Paris Adult
Theatre I,* when the material in question is not directed to a "bizarre,
deviant group" not within the experience of the average person, the best
evidence is the material, which "can and does speak for itself." 

In deciding this case, the court's decision is not based upon the
undersigned judge's personal opinion as to the obscenity of the work,
but is an application of the law to the facts based upon the trier of
fact's personal knowledge of community standards. In other works, even
if the undersigned judge would not find *As Nasty As They Wanna Be*
obscene, he would be compelled to do so if the community's standards so
required.

The true basis of the plaintiffs' argument is that the legal standard of
the "community" and the "average person" are too nebulous to apply to an
issue of constitutional law. This position ignores the fact that the law
does not require absolute certainty as to its determinations. The
standard of proof is adjusted upward or downward to reflect the balance
between the competing rights of individuals and society. In civil cases,
the law gives effect to a determination based on a preponderance of the
evidence. Even in criminal matters where a person can lose his liberty,
property, and even his life, there is no requirement that the government
prove guilt beyond all possible doubt. As noted in [*Hamling v. United
States*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=487349011929396754&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1974), 
"It is common experience that different juries may reach different
results &hellip; This is one of the consequences we accept under our jury
system." The same holds true when the court is the finder of fact in a
bench trial. Application of the "community" and "average person"
standards are no different than that of applying the standard of the
"reasonable person" used in negligence and tort law. 

### The First Miller Test: Prurient Interest

This court finds, as a matter of fact, that the recording *As Nasty As
They Wanna Be* appeals to the prurient interest. The Supreme Court has
defined prurient as "material having a tendency to excite lustful
thoughts." *Roth*.
Appeals only to "normal, healthy sexual desires" are not adequate to
meet the test. [*Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975894151134542505&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1985).
The material must exhibit a "shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex,
or excretion". 

*Nasty* appeals to the prurient interest for several reasons. First, its
lyrics and the titles of its songs are replete with references to female
and male genitalia, human sexual excretion, oral-anal contact, fellatio,
group sex, specific sexual positions, sadomasochism, the turgid state of
the male sexual organ, masturbation, cunnilingus, sexual intercourse,
and the sounds of moaning. Florida's Legislature has provided a valuable
source of evidence in the form of its obscenity statutes for determining
what is sexual conduct. Florida Statutes define "sexual conduct" to include "actual or
simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse &hellip; masturbation &hellip; sadomasochistic abuse; [or] actual lewd exhibition of
the genitals." Florida Statutes define deviate
sexual intercourse as sexual conduct between unmarried persons involving
contact between the penis and the anus, the mouth and the penis, or the
mouth and the vulva. Another section defines sadomasochistic abuse as
satisfaction from sadistic violence derived by inflicting harm upon
another. These definitions cover most, if not all, of the sexual acts
depicted in *As Nasty As They Wanna Be.*

Furthermore, the frequency and graphic description of the sexual lyrics
evinces a clear intention to lure hearers into this activity. The
depictions of ultimate sexual acts are so vivid that they are hard to
distinguish from seeing the same conduct described in the words of a
book, or in pictures in periodicals or films.

It is also noteworthy that the material here is music. It is true that
it would be difficult, albeit not impossible, to find that mere sound
without lyrics is obscene. Music is sufficiently subjective that
reasonable persons could disagree as to its meaning. But, the focus of
the *Nasty* recording is its lyrics. Based on the evidence at trial,
music of the "rap" genre focuses upon verbal messages accentuated by a
strong beat. 2 Live Crew itself testified that the *Nasty* recording was
made to be listened and danced to. The evident goal of this particular
recording is to reproduce the sexual act through musical lyrics. It is
an appeal directed to "dirty" thoughts and the loins, not to the
intellect and the mind.

The court has also given some, but not great, weight to the plaintiffs'
commercial motive. Of course, the fact that the plaintiffs made a profit
from the public distribution of the *Nasty* recording is not relevant in
determining obscenity. 
However, the court can consider the manner in which the material was
distributed and promoted to determine if the "leer of the sensualist"
permeates the work. 
In *Ginzburg,* the court found that publishers of certain
magazines and books had directed their advertising in such a way as to
commercially exploit erotica solely for the sake of their prurient
appeal. For example, the advertisements
sent to potential customers "stressed the sexual candor of the
respective publications, and openly boasted that the publishers would
take full advantage of what they regarded [as] an unrestricted license
allowed by law in the expression of sex and sexual matters." 
The Court went on to  note that, "the
deliberate representation of petitioners' publications as erotically
arousing, for example, stimulated the reader to accept them as prurient;
he looks for titillation, not for saving intellectual content." 

Consideration of the creator's intent to appeal to the prurient interest
is still a valid consideration today, even after [*Miller v.
California*][miller].

The record at trial indicates that the plaintiffs' commercial
exploitation of this work was done in a manner calculated to make a salacious appeal. 
The title of the recording, *As Nasty As They Want To Be,* 
in addition to the names of many of the songs and the illustration
on the recordings' insert certainly fit within the confines of the
*Ginzburg* case for materials "looking for titilation."

One of the more interesting points suggested by the evidence at trial,
but not dwelt on by the defendant, was that 2 Live Crew made two
apparently identical albums with the only difference being the sexually
explicit lyrics. The plaintiffs' own expert, John Leland, testified that
the *Nasty* recording, without the salacious lyrics, would not have been
expected to sell more than 500,000 copies nationwide. To date, the
*Nasty* version has sold 1.7 million copies. The identical recording
sans sexual lyrics (*Clean*) has sold only 250,000 copies. The
difference between the actual sales of the two recordings can reasonably
be found to have been motivated by the "leer of the sensualist". The
plaintiffs cannot claim they needed the vulgar lyrics to promote their
message since the plaintiffs' own experts testified that music from
neither the "rap" or "hip-hop" genre does not require the use of such
language.

Finally, the plaintiffs rely upon testimony, both lay and expert, that
the *Nasty* recording did not actually physically excite anyone who
heard it and indeed, caused boredom after repeated play. However, based
on the graphic deluge of sexual lyrics about nudity and sexual conduct,
this court has no difficulty in finding that *As Nasty As They Wanna Be*
appeals to a shameful and morbid interest in sex.

### The Second Miller Test: Patently Offensive

The court also finds that the second element of the *Miller* test is
satisfied in that the *Nasty* recording is patently offensive. This is a
question of fact, which must be measured by contemporary community
standards.  [*Miller*][miller].

It is quite true that not all speech with sex as its topic is obscene.
The *As Nasty As They Wanna Be* recording is another matter.

The recording depicts sexual conduct in graphic detail. The specificity
of the descriptions makes the audio message analogous to a camera with a
zoom lens, focusing on the sights and sounds of various ultimate sex
acts. Furthermore, the frequency of the sexual lyrics must also be
considered. With the exception of part B on Side 1, the entire *Nasty*
recording is replete with explicit sexual lyrics. This is not a case of
subtle references or innuendo, nor is it just "one particular scurrilous
epithet" as in [*Cohen v. California*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1971).

As already noted, Florida's Legislature has defined obscene acts to
include sadomasochistic sexual conduct, oral sex, and anal intercourse.
In addition,
Florida's obscenity statutes are intended to have the broadest,
constitutional scope. 
States may outlaw certain portrayals of sexual conduct and nudity if
they constitute "hardcore pornography." *See* [*Jenkins v. Georgia*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10639986226512069424&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1974).
In *Jenkins,* the Supreme Court reversed a conviction for distribution
of the film "Carnal Knowledge" which contained scenes of a woman with a
bare midriff and several lovemaking sessions. 
This depiction was held by the Court to not be within the
hardcore category. As noted by the Court,

> While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex,
> and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including "ultimate
> sexual acts" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does
> not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no
> exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during
> these scenes. There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone
> is not enough to make material legally obscene under the *Miller*
> standards. 

In *Miller,* the Supreme Court gave two examples of the type of conduct
subject to state regulation: "(a) Patently offensive representations or
descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or
simulated. (b) Patently offensive representation or descriptions of
masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals."
The conduct described in the *Nasty* recording is certainly within the
scope of the Florida statutes. The state law, of course, is not
dispositive on the question of whether this particular community would
be patently offended, but it is entitled to significant weight.

While the above facts are sufficient to support a finding that this
material is patently offensive, there are additional considerations that
support such a finding. First, the *Nasty* lyrics contain what are
commonly known as "dirty words" and depictions of female abuse and
violence. It is likely that these offensive descriptions would not of
themselves be sufficient to find the recording obscene. *See, e.g.,*
[*American Booksellers Association, Inc. v. Hudnut*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10304718398250731275&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
(7th Cir. 1985).
When these terms are used with explicit sexual descriptions, however, they
may be considered on the issue of patent offensiveness. Secondly, the
material here is music which can certainly be more intrusive to the
unwilling listener than other forms of communication. Unlike a video
tape, a book, or a periodical, music must be played to be experienced. A
person can sit in public and look at an obscene magazine without unduly
intruding upon another's privacy; but, even according to the plaintiffs'
testimony, music is made to be played and listened to. A person laying
on a public beach, sitting in a public park, walking down the street, or
sitting in his automobile waiting for the light to change is, in a
sense, a captive audience. While the law does require citizens to avert
their ears when speech is merely offensive, they do not have an
obligation to buy and use ear plugs in public if the state legislature
has chosen to protect them from obscenity.

Finally, in determining whether the *Nasty* recording is patently
offensive, it is again proper to consider the plaintiffs' commercial
exploitation of sex to promote sales. As noted by the Supreme Court in
[*Ginzburg v. United States*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1966), 
representations of a publication as erotically arousing "would tend to
force public confrontation with the potentially offensive aspects of the
work; the brazenness of such an appeal heightens the offensiveness of
the publications to those who are offended by such material." Such is
the case here, as already discussed. Again, while this factor has not
been given great weight, it is entitled to consideration.

### The Third Miller Test: Social Value

The final factor under *Miller* is whether the *Nasty* recording, taken
as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value. This factor is not measured by community standards. The proper
inquiry is whether a reasonable person would find serious social value
in the material at issue. 
The plaintiffs correctly note that the value of a work can pass muster
under *Miller* if it has serious merit, measured objectively, even if a
majority of the community would not agree.

As a preliminary matter, it is again important to note what this case is
*not* about. Neither the "Rap" or "Hip-Hop" musical genres are on trial.
The narrow issue before this court is whether the recording entitled *As
Nasty As They Wanna Be* is legally obscene.

This is also not a case about whether the group 2 Live Crew or any of
its other music is obscene. The third element of the *Miller* test
focuses upon the social value of the particular work, not its creators.
The fact that individuals of whom we approve hold objectionable ideas or
that people of whom we do not approve hold worthy ideas does not affect
judicial review of the value of the ideas themselves.

The Phillistines are not always wrong, nor are the guardians of the
First Amendment always right.

This court must examine the *Nasty* recording for its content; the
inquiry is objective, not *ad hominem.*

Finally, this court's role is not to serve as a censor or an art and
music critic. If the *Nasty* recording has serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value, it is irrelevant that the work is not
stylish, tasteful, or even popular.

The plaintiffs themselves testified that neither their music nor their
lyrics were created to convey a political message.

The only witness testifying at trial that there was political content in
the *Nasty* recording was Carlton Long, who was qualified as an expert
on the culture of black Americans. This witness first stated that the
recording was political because the 2 Live Crew, as a group of black
Americans, used this medium to express themselves. While it is doubtless
true that *Nasty* is a product of the group's background, including
their heritage as black Americans, this fact does not convert whatever
they say, or sing, into political speech. Professor Long also testified
that the following passages from the recording contained political
content: a four sentence phrase in the song "Dirty Nursery Rhymes" about
Abraham Lincoln, the word "man" in the Georgie Porgie portion of the
same song, and the use of the device of "boasting" to stress one's
manhood. Even giving these isolated lyrics the meaning attributed by the
expert, they are not sufficient in number or significance to give the
*Nasty* recording, as a whole, any serious political value.

In terms of science, Professor Long also suggested that there is
cultural content in 2 Live Crew's recording which rises to the level of
serious sociological value. According to this witness, white Americans
"hear" the *Nasty* recording in a different way than black Americans
because of their different frames of references. Long identifies three
cultural devices evident in the work here: "call and response", "doing
the dozens", and "boasting". The court finds none of these arguments
persuasive.

The only examples of "call and response" in the *Nasty* recording are
portions where males and females yell, in repetitive verse, "Tastes
Great—Less Filling" and, in another song, assail campus Greek-letter
group. The phrases alone have no significant artistic merit nor are they
examples of black American culture. In the case of "Tastes Great—Less
Filling", this is merely a phrase lifted from a beer commercial.

The device of "doing the dozens" is a word game composed of a series of
insults escalating in their satirical content. The "boasting" device is
a way for persons to overstate their virtues such as sexual prowess.

While this court does not doubt that both "boasting" and "doing the
dozens" are found in the culture of black Americans, these devices are
also found in other cultures. "Doing the dozens" is commonly seen in
adolescents, especially boys, of all races. "Boasting" seems to be part
of the universal human condition.

Professor Long also cited to several different examples of literary
devices such as  rhyme and allusion which appear in *Nasty,* and
points to the song title "Dick Almighty" as an example of the literary
device of personification. This, of course, is nonsense regardless of
the expert's credentials. "A quotation from Voltaire in the fly leaf of
a book", noted the Supreme Court in *Miller,* "will not constitutionally
redeem an otherwise obscene publication." 

Prior to *Miller,* the government had to demonstrate that a work was
utterly without redeeming social value to be judged obscene. 
The present test is less stringent, only requiring proof of an absence
of serious social worth. This leads to the plaintiffs' strongest
argument: that the *Nasty* recording has serious artistic value. This
category of social worth is broad enough to include the value
contributed by the political, literary, and cultural aspects of the
particular work.

The plaintiffs stress that the *Nasty* recording has value as comedy and
satire. Certainly, people can and do laugh at obscenity. The plaintiffs
point to the audience reaction at trial when the subject recording was
played in open court. The audience giggled initially, but the court
observed that after the initial titillation, it fell silent.

In a society where obscenity is forbidden, it is human nature to want
taste forbidden fruit. It is quite another thing to say that this aspect
of humanity forms the basis for finding that *Nasty* has serious
artistic value. Furthermore, laughter can express much more than
enjoyment and entertainment. It is also a means of hiding embarrassment,
concealing shame, and releasing tension. The fact that laughter was only
heard at the time that the first song of the tape was played is
probative on what the audience's outbursts really meant. It cannot be
reasonably argued that the violence, perversion, abuse of women, graphic
depictions of all forms of sexual conduct, and miscroscopic descriptions
of human genitilia contained on this recording are comedic art.

The *Nasty* recording is not comedy, but is first and foremost, music.
Initially, it would appear very difficult to find a musical work
obscene. As noted by the American Civil Liberties Union, the meaning of
music is subjective and subject only to the limits of the listener's
imagination. *See* ACLU Brief at 3.

Music nevertheless is not exempt from a state's obscenity statutes.
Musical works are obscene if they meet the *Miller* test. Certainly it
would be possible to compose an obscene oratoro or opera and it has
probably been done.

The plaintiffs claim that this case is novel since it seeks to determine
whether music can be obscene. The particular work here, although
belonging to the general category of music, however, is to be
distinguished from a purely instrumental work, or other more common
recordings with a fairly equal emphasis on music and lyrics. The focus
of the *Nasty* recording is predominately on the lyrics. Expert
testimony at trial indicates that a central characteristic of "rap"
music is its emphasis on the *verbal* message. Rhythm is stressed over
melody, not for its own sake, but to accentuate the words of the song.
The pounding beat and the presence of near continuous lyrics support
this conclusion. 2 Live Crew's music is explicitly clear as to its
message. Although music and lyrics must be considered jointly, it does
not significantly alter the message of the *Nasty* recording to reduce
it to a written transcription. The Supreme Court's decision in [*Kaplan
v. California*][kaplan] is applicable here. The Court held that an expression by words alone,
albeit in a written form, can be legally obscene even if there are no
accompanying pictorial depictions. 
The case at bar is an extension of the law to the extent that
words, as lyrics in music, can be obscene.

The key to judging the *Nasty* recording is to consider it as a whole. 2
Live Crew has "borrowed" components called "riffs"  from other
artists. Taking the work in its entirety, the several riffs do not lift
*Nasty* to the level of a serious artistic work. Once the riffs are
removed, all that remains is the rhythm and the explicit sexual lyrics
which are utterly without any redeeming social value.

Obscenity is not a required element for socially valuable "rap" or
"hip-hop" music. 2 Live Crew itself proved this point by the creation of
its *Clean* recording.

The court is reminded of a story by Charles Baudelaire, a poet who also
had problems with the civil authorities of his day. In *My Heart Laid
Bare* (Vanguard Press 1951), at pages 203-04, he writes:

> All the imbeciles of the Bourgeoisie who intentionally use the words,
> "immoral", "immorality", "morality in art" and other such stupid
> expressions remind me of Louise Villdieu, a five-franc whore who once
> went with me to the Louvre. She has never been there before, and began
> to blush and cover her face with her hands, repeatedly plucking at my
> sleeve and asking me, as we stood before deathless statutes and
> pictures, how such indecencies could be flaunted in public.

One of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses testified at trial that material
is art if it causes a reaction in the audience perceiving it. If that
reaction is an appeal to the prurient interest in a patently offensive
way, and if the material lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific, the law does not call that art—it calls it obscenity and
when so proven beyond a reasonable doubt is a crime in Florida.

### Obscenity? Yes!

The recording *As Nasty As They Wanna Be,* taken as a whole, is legally
obscene.

The court so finds by a preponderance of the evidence although the
standard of proof presents no real issue.

The court also finds *As Nasty As They Wanna Be* to be legally obscene
under the *Miller* test by clear and convincing evidence, which standard
the plaintiffs maintain is the correct burden of proof.

### Prior Restraint And Procedural Due Process

A prior restraint can be generally defined as any condition imposed by
the government on the publication of speech. 
Such a limitation can come in varying forms including permit
requirements, licensing taxes, registration, prepublication submission
of materials, seizures, and judicial injunctions. The distinguishing
characteristic of a prior restraint is that the condition vests power in
a nonjudicial official to make the final decision as to whether speech
will be permitted at all or in what form. 

Prior restraints are repugnant to the right of free speech. The First
Amendment prohibits this type of regulation to minimize the risk of
governmental censorship. Many forms of speech are of value because of
the urgency and immediacy of the idea expressed. Even if a censor
ultimately allows publication, significant delay in the decisionmaking
process can destroy the fleeting value of the speech. 
If speech is delayed or denied, the rights of both
the speaker and his audience are impaired and society is the ultimate
"loser." 
Furthermore, if allowed, prior restraints necessarily legitimatize the
existence of a censor. The danger is that officials, even if originally
well-intentioned, may be driven to suppress an ever growing amount of
speech.

For all of these reasons, the First Amendment casts a jaundiced
eye on any form of prior restraint. But, as with the right of free
speech itself, this prohibition is not absolute. A limitation on speech
prior to its publication may withstand constitutional scrutiny in
"exceptional cases." [*Near v. Minnesota*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10240616562166401834&q=luke+records+navarro&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (US 1931).
Included within this category are all types of speech unprotected by the
Constitution such as obscenity. 

The fact that the government may prevent obscene materials from ever
reaching their intended audience assumes that the issue of obscenity has
already been decided. It is the courts and not nonjudicial officials who
must decide whether a specific work is obscene. 
Interpreting obscenity laws requires "appraisal of facts, the exercise
of judgment, and the formation of an opinion"; in other words, the
exercise of judicial power. 

Because of this presumption, the state must follow constitutionally
mandated procedures in seizing obscene works. The state may criminalize
obscenity, but its regulation must comport with the minimum procedural
safeguards required by due process. To trigger the Fourteenth
Amendment's application, the state regulation must constitute a
deprivation of a protected interest. Florida law provides that no
property interest exists in obscene materials. 
In essence, this state has made obscenity a form
of contraband, the seizure of which would not normally implicate the
Fourteenth Amendment. However, because free speech has an independent
source of protection under the First Amendment as a constitutional
"liberty", arguably obscene articles are not treated by the law like
other contraband such as illegal drugs. 

### Ordered And Adjudged As Follows:

1. The recording *As Nasty As They Wanna Be* created by the group 2
Live Crew is hereby DECLARED obscene.

2. The action of the Broward County Sheriff's office in threatening
retail music stores with arrest for selling the *Nasty* recording and
presenting them with a copy of a probable cause order is hereby DECLARED
unconstitutional as an improper prior restraint of free speech in
violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.

## Child Pornography 

In [*New York v. Ferber*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Ferber) (US 1982), 
the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the State of New York 
could ban the sale of material depicting children engaged in sexual activity. 

Child pornography, the court said, is unprotected speech, 
not because it is obscene, 
but because actual children are harmed in the making of it, 
and the resulting product provides a permanent record of the harm done, 
capable of inflicting grievous damage on child actors long afterwards.

Which raised the question: 
What about virtual child pornography, 
in which no actual children are used as actors?

* [case at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition)

Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.

#### Excerpts from the *Ashcroft* opinion:

We consider in this case 
whether the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 
(CPPA) abridges the freedom of speech. 
The CPPA extends the federal prohibition against child pornography 
to sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors 
but were produced without using any real children. 
The statute prohibits, in specific circumstances, 
possessing or distributing these images, 
which may be created by using adults who look like minors 
or by using computer imaging. 
The new technology, according to Congress, 
makes it possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist. 
See Congressional Findings, notes following 18 U. S. C. § 2251.

By prohibiting child pornography that does not depict an actual child,
the statute goes beyond [*New York* v. *Ferber*][ferber] (US 1982), 
which distinguished child pornography 
from other sexually explicit speech 
because of the State's interest in protecting the children
exploited by the production process. 
As a general rule, pornography can be banned only if obscene, 
but under *Ferber,* pornography showing minors can be proscribed 
whether or not the images are obscene under the definition set forth in 
[*Miller* v. *California*][miller]
(US 1973).
*Ferber* recognized that "the *Miller* standard, 
like all general definitions of what may be banned as obscene, 
does not reflect the State's particular and more compelling interest 
in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation of children." [*Ferber*][ferber].

While we have not had occasion to consider the question, 
we may assume that the apparent age of persons engaged in sexual conduct 
is relevant to whether a depiction offends community standards. 
Pictures of young children engaged in certain acts might be obscene 
where similar depictions of adults, 
or perhaps even older adolescents, would not. 
The CPPA, however, is not directed at speech that is obscene; 
Congress has proscribed those materials through a separate statute. 
18 U. S. C. §§ 1460-1466. 
Like the law in *Ferber,* 
the CPPA seeks to reach beyond obscenity, 
and it makes no attempt to conform to the *Miller* standard.
For instance, the statute would reach visual depictions, such as movies,
even if they have redeeming social value.

The principal question to be resolved, then, 
is whether the CPPA is constitutional 
where it proscribes a significant universe of speech 
that is neither obscene under *Miller* 
nor child pornography under *Ferber.*

####  I

Before 1996, 
Congress defined child pornography as 
the type of depictions at issue in *Ferber,* 
images made using actual minors.
The CPPA retains that prohibition 
and adds three other prohibited categories of speech, of
which the first, § 2256(8)(B), and the third, § 2256(8)(D), are at issue
in this case. Section 2256(8)(B) prohibits:

> "any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or
computer-generated image or picture," that "is, or appears to be, of a
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 

The prohibition on "any visual depiction" 
does not depend at all on how the image is produced.
The section captures a range of depictions, 
sometimes called "virtual child pornography," 
which include computer-generated images, 
as well as images produced by more traditional means. 
For instance, the literal terms of the statute 
embrace a Renaissance painting depicting a scene from classical mythology, 
a "picture" that "appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 
The statute also prohibits Hollywood movies, 
filmed without any child actors, 
if a jury believes an actor 
"appears to be" a minor engaging in "actual or simulated &hellip; sexual intercourse." 

These images do not involve, let alone harm, 
any children in the production process; 
but Congress decided the materials threaten children in other, less direct, ways. 
Pedophiles might use the materials 
to encourage children to participate in sexual activity. 
"A child who is reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, 
or to pose for sexually explicit photographs, 
can sometimes be convinced 
by viewing depictions of other children 
'having fun' participating in such activity." &hellip; 
Furthermore, pedophiles might 
"whet their own sexual appetites" with the pornographic images, 
"thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography 
and the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children." &hellip; 
Under these rationales, harm flows from the content of the images, 
not from the means of their production. 

In addition, Congress identified another problem 
created by computer-generated images: 
Their existence can make it harder to prosecute pornographers 
who do use real minors.&hellip; As imaging technology improves, 
Congress found, it becomes more difficult to prove 
that a particular picture was produced using actual children. 
To ensure that defendants possessing child
pornography using real minors cannot evade prosecution, 
Congress extended the ban to virtual child pornography.

Section 2256(8)(C) prohibits a more common and lower tech means 
of creating virtual images, known as computer morphing. 
Rather than creating original images, 
pornographers can alter innocent pictures of real children 
so that the children appear to be engaged in sexual activity. 
Although morphed images may fall within the definition of virtual child pornography, 
they implicate the interests of real children
and are in that sense closer to the images in *Ferber.* 
Respondents do not challenge this provision, and we do not consider it.

Respondents do challenge § 2256(8)(D). 
Like the text of the "appears to be" provision, 
the sweep of this provision is quite broad. 
Section 2256(8)(D) defines child pornography 
to include any sexually explicit image that was:

> "advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed 
> in such a manner that conveys the impression" 
> it depicts "a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 

One Committee Report
identified the provision as directed at sexually explicit images
pandered as child pornography. 
("This provision prevents child pornographers and pedophiles 
from exploiting prurient interests in child sexuality and sexual activity
through the production or distribution of pornographic material 
which is intentionally pandered as child pornography"). 
The statute is not so limited in its reach, however, 
as it punishes even those possessors who took no part in pandering. 
Once a work has been described as child pornography, 
the taint remains on the speech in the hands of subsequent possessors, 
making possession unlawful 
even though the content otherwise would not be objectionable.

Fearing that the CPPA threatened the activities of its members,
respondent Free Speech Coalition and others challenged the statute 
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 
The Coalition, 
a California trade association for the adult-entertainment industry, 
alleged that its members did not use minors in their sexually explicit works, 
but they believed some of these materials 
might fall within the CPPA's expanded definition of child pornography. 
The other respondents are Bold Type, Inc., 
the publisher of a book advocating the nudist lifestyle; 
Jim Gingerich, a painter of nudes; 
and Ron Raffaelli, a photographer specializing in erotic images.
Respondents alleged that the "appears to be" 
and "conveys the impression" provisions are overbroad and vague, 
chilling them from producing works protected by the First Amendment. 
The District Court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the Government. 
The court dismissed the overbreadth claim because it was "highly unlikely" that
any "adaptations of sexual works like 'Romeo and Juliet,' . . . will be
treated as 'criminal contraband.'" 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [reversed](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018).
The court reasoned that the Government could not prohibit speech 
because of its tendency to persuade viewers to commit illegal acts. 
The court held the CPPA to be substantially overbroad 
because it bans materials that are neither obscene 
nor produced by the exploitation of real children as in [*New York* v. *Ferber*][ferber]. 
Judge Ferguson dissented on the ground that virtual images, 
like obscenity and real child pornography, 
should be treated as a category of speech unprotected by the First Amendment. 
The Court of Appeals voted to deny the petition for rehearing
en banc, over the dissent of three judges. 

While the Ninth Circuit found the CPPA invalid on its face, four other Courts of Appeals have sustained it. 

We granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1124 (2001).

#### II

The First Amendment commands, 
"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." 
The government may violate this mandate in many ways &hellip; 
but a law imposing criminal penalties on protected speech 
is a stark example of speech suppression. 
The CPPA's penalties are indeed severe. 
A first offender may be imprisoned for 15 years. § 2252A(b)(1). 
A repeat offender faces a prison sentence of not less than 5 years 
and not more than 30 years in prison. *Ibid.* 
While even minor punishments can chill protected speech, 
see [*Wooley* v. *Maynard*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15210508422263730617) (US 1977),
this case provides a textbook example 
of why we permit facial challenges to statutes that burden expression. 
With these severe penalties in force, 
few legitimate movie producers or book publishers, 
or few other speakers in any capacity, 
would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this law. 
The Constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws 
that chill speech within the First Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. 
Under this principle, 
the CPPA is unconstitutional on its face 
if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression. 
See [*Broadrick* v. *Oklahoma*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375) (US 1973).

The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime 
and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people. 
In its legislative findings, 
Congress recognized that there are subcultures of persons 
who harbor illicit desires for children 
and commit criminal acts to gratify the impulses. &hellip; 
See &hellip; also U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Administration on
Children, Youth and Families, Child Maltreatment 1999 (estimating that
93,000 children were victims of sexual abuse in 1999). 
Congress also found that surrounding the serious offenders 
are those who flirt with these impulses 
and trade pictures and written accounts of sexual activity with young children.

Congress may pass valid laws to protect children from abuse, and it has.
The prospect of crime, however, by itself 
does not justify laws suppressing protected speech. See
[*Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.* v. *Regents of Univ. of N. Y.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3228427129910896091) (US 1959) ("Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent
crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not
abridgment of the rights of free speech" (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)). It is also well established that speech may not be
prohibited because it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities. See
[*FCC* v. *Pacifica Foundation*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9738309099999149495) (US 1978)
("The fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient
reason for suppressing it"); see also [*Reno* v. *American Civil
Liberties Union*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1557224836887427725) (US 1997)
("In evaluating the free speech rights of adults, we have made it
perfectly clear that 'sexual expression which is indecent but not
obscene is protected by the First Amendment'") (quoting [*Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc.* v. *FCC*][sable] (US 1989); 
[*Carey* v. *Population Services Int'l*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4801034783278981738) (US 1977) ("The fact that protected speech may be offensive to some does not justify its suppression").

As a general principle, 
the First Amendment bars the government 
from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear. 
The freedom of speech has its limits; 
it does not embrace certain categories of speech, 
including defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real children. 
See [*Simon & Schuster, Inc.* v. *Members of N. Y.* *State Crime Victims Bd.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=988401867966498877)
(US 1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring). 
While these categories may be prohibited without violating the First Amendment, 
none of them includes the speech prohibited by the CPPA. 
In his dissent from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, 
Judge Ferguson recognized this to be the law 
and proposed that virtual child pornography should be regarded 
as [an additional category of unprotected speech](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018). It would be necessary for us to take this step to uphold the statute.

As we have noted, the CPPA is much more than a supplement 
to the existing federal prohibition on obscenity. 
Under [*Miller*][miller],
the Government must prove that the work, 
taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, 
is patently offensive in light of community standards, 
and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
The CPPA, however, extends to images 
that appear to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity 
without regard to the *Miller* requirements. 
The materials need not appeal to the prurient interest. 
Any depiction of sexually explicit activity, 
no matter how it is presented, is proscribed. 
The CPPA applies to a picture in a psychology manual,
as well as a movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse. 
It is not necessary, moreover, that the image be patently offensive. 
Pictures of what appear to be 17-year-olds 
engaging in sexually explicit activity 
do not in every case contravene community standards.

The CPPA prohibits speech 
despite its serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
The statute proscribes the visual depiction of an idea---that of teenagers 
engaging in sexual activity---that is a fact of modern society 
and has been a theme in art and literature throughout the ages. 
Under the CPPA, 
images are prohibited so long as the persons appear to be under 18 years of age.
This is higher than the legal age for marriage in many States,
as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations &hellip;
(48 States permit 16-year-olds to marry with parental consent) &hellip; 
(in 39 States and the District of Columbia, the age
of consent is 16 or younger). 
It is, of course,
undeniable that some youths engage in sexual activity before the legal age,
either on their own inclination or because they are victims of sexual
abuse.

Both themes---teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of
children---have inspired countless literary works. William Shakespeare
created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13
years of age. See Romeo and Juliet, ("She hath not
seen the change of fourteen years"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays
the relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not juvenile.
The work has inspired no less than 40 motion pictures, some of which
suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship.
Shakespeare may not have
written sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but were
modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach, that fact alone
would not compel the conclusion that the work was obscene.

Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's Academy Awards
featured the movie, *Traffic*, which was nominated for Best Picture. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16year-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her  to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before, American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the course of the movie, a
teenage girl engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, and
another yields herself to the gratification of a middle-aged man. The
film also contains a scene where, although the movie audience
understands the act is not taking place, one character believes he is
watching a teenage boy performing a sexual act on an older man.

Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring fascination
with the lives and destinies of the young. 
Art and literature express the vital interest we all have 
in the formative years we ourselves once
knew, when wounds can be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and
mistaken choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self-fulfillment are
still in reach. Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA,
they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions.
If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those
subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within
the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to
severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value. This
is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: 
The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit
scene. See [*Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"*
v. *Attorney General of Mass.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10189557359995044131)
(US 1966) (plurality opinion) ("The social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor
canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness"). Under
*Miller,* the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by
considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the
narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even
though the scene in isolation might be offensive. 

For this reason, and the others we have noted, the CPPA cannot be read
to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its
prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the
definition of obscenity.

The Government seeks to address this deficiency by arguing that speech
prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from child
pornography, which may be banned without regard to whether it depicts
works of value. See [*New York* v. *Ferber*][ferber].
Where the images are themselves the product of child sexual abuse,
*Ferber* recognized that the State had an interest in stamping it out
without regard to any judgment about its content. See also *id.,* at 775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("As drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication of
particular ideas"). The production of the work, not its content, was the
target of the statute. The fact that a work contained serious literary,
artistic, or other value did not excuse the harm it caused to its child
participants. It was simply "unrealistic to equate a community's
toleration for sexually oriented materials with the permissible scope of
legislation aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation."

*Ferber* upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale of child pornography, 
as well as its production, 
because these acts were "intrinsically related" 
to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. 
First, as a permanent record of a child's abuse, 
the continued circulation itself would harm the child who had participated.
Like a defamatory statement, 
each new publication of the speech 
would cause new injury to the child's reputation and emotional well-being. 
Second, because the traffic in child pornography 
was an economic motive for its production, 
the State had an interest in closing the distribution network. 
"The most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement 
may be to dry up the market for this material 
by imposing severe criminal penalties 
on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product." 
Under either rationale, the speech had what the Court in
effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came.

Later, in [*Osborne* v. *Ohio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777) (US 1990), 
the Court ruled that these same interests justified a ban on the
possession of pornography produced by using children. "Given the
importance of the State's interest in protecting the victims of child
pornography," the State was justified in "attempting to stamp out this
vice at all levels in the distribution chain." *Id.,* at 110. *Osborne*
also noted the State's interest in preventing child pornography from
being used as an aid in the solicitation of minors. *Id.,* at 111. The
Court, however, anchored its holding in the concern for the
participants, those whom it called the "victims of child pornography."
*Id.,* at 110. It did not suggest that, absent this concern, other
governmental interests would suffice. See *infra,* at 251-253.

In contrast to the speech in *Ferber,* 
speech that itself is the record of sexual abuse, 
the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. 
Virtual child pornography is not "intrinsically related" 
to the sexual abuse of children, as were the materials in *Ferber.*
While the Government asserts that the images 
can lead to actual instances of child abuse &hellip; 
the causal link is contingent and indirect. 
The harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, 
but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts.

The Government says these indirect harms are sufficient 
because, as *Ferber* acknowledged, 
child pornography rarely can be valuable speech.
See [458 U. S., at 762][ferber]
("The value of permitting live performances and photographic
reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly
modest, if not *de minimis* "). This argument, however, suffers from two
flaws. First, *Ferber's* judgment about child pornography was
based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated. The case
reaffirmed that where the speech is neither obscene nor the product of
sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the protection of the First
Amendment. See *id.,* at 764-765 ("[T]he distribution of descriptions or
other depictions of sexual conduct, not otherwise obscene, which do not
involve live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of
live performances, retains First Amendment protection").

The second flaw in the Government's position is that *Ferber* did not
hold that child pornography is by definition without value. On the
contrary, the Court recognized some works in this category might have
significant value, see *id.,* at 761, but relied on virtual images---the
very images prohibited by the CPPA---as an alternative and permissible
means of expression: "[I]f it were necessary for literary or artistic
value, a person over the statutory age who perhaps looked younger could
be utilized. Simulation outside of the prohibition of the statute could
provide another alternative." *Id.,* at 763. *Ferber,* then, not only
referred to the distinction between actual and virtual child
pornography, it relied on it as a reason supporting its holding.
*Ferber* provides no support for a statute that eliminates the
distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as well.

#### III

The CPPA, for reasons we have explored, is inconsistent with *Miller*
and finds no support in *Ferber.* 
The Government seeks to justify its prohibitions in other ways. 
It argues that the CPPA is necessary 
because pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children. 
There are many things innocent in themselves, however, 
such as cartoons, video games, and candy, 
that might be used for immoral purposes, 
yet we would not expect those to be prohibited 
because they can be misused. 
The Government, of course, may punish adults who provide unsuitable
materials  to children, see [*Ginsberg* v. *New York*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773) (US 1968),
and it may enforce criminal penalties for unlawful solicitation. 
The precedents establish, however, 
that speech within the rights of adults to hear 
may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children
from it. See [*Sable Communications*][sable].
In [*Butler* v. *Michigan*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8098803622147894006) (US 1957), 
the Court invalidated a statute prohibiting distribution of an indecent
publication because of its tendency to "'incite minors to violent or
depraved or immoral acts.' " A unanimous Court agreed upon the important
First Amendment principle that the State could not "reduce the adult
population . . . to reading only what is fit for children." *Id.,* at
383. We have reaffirmed this holding. See [*United States* v. *Playboy
Entertainment Group, Inc.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695) (US 2000)
("The objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a
blanket ban if the protection can be accomplished by a less restrictive
alternative"); [*Reno* v. *American Civil Liberties Union*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1557224836887427725) (The "governmental interest in protecting children from harmful
materials . . . does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of
speech addressed to adults"); [*Sable Communications*][sable] 
(striking down a ban on "dial-a-porn" messages that had "the invalid
effect of limiting the content of adult telephone conversations to that
which is suitable for children to hear").

Here, the Government wants to keep speech from children not to protect
them from its content but to protect them from those who would commit
other crimes. The principle, however, remains the same: The Government
cannot ban speech fit for adults simply because it may fall into the
hands of children. The evil in question depends upon the actor's
unlawful conduct, conduct defined as criminal quite apart from any link
to the speech in question. This establishes that the speech ban is not
narrowly drawn. The objective is to prohibit illegal conduct, but this
restriction goes well  beyond that interest by restricting the
speech available to law-abiding adults.

The Government submits further that virtual child pornography whets the
appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal
conduct. This rationale cannot sustain the provision in question. The
mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient
reason for banning it. The government "cannot constitutionally premise
legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's private
thoughts." [*Stanley* v. *Georgia*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6728320798248524934&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (US 1969).
First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to
control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end. The
right to think is the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected
from the government because speech is the beginning of thought.

To preserve these freedoms, and to protect speech for its own sake, the
Court's First Amendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and
deeds, between ideas and conduct. See [*Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3228427129910896091&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
see also [*Bartnicki* v. *Vopper,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2171346211086974391&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (US 2001)
("The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an
appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it"). The government
may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act
will be committed "at some indefinite future time." [*Hess* v.
*Indiana* (US 1973) *(per
curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4042159652386241321&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
The government may suppress speech for advocating the use of force or a
violation of law only if "such advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action." [*Brandenburg* v. *Ohio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (US 1969). 
There is here no attempt, incitement, solicitation, or conspiracy. The
Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech
that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse.
Without a significantly stronger, more direct connection, the Government
may not prohibit  speech on the ground that it may encourage
pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.

The Government next argues that its objective of eliminating the market
for pornography produced using real children necessitates a prohibition
on virtual images as well. Virtual images, the Government contends, are
indistinguishable from real ones; they are part of the same market and
are often exchanged. In this way, it is said, virtual images promote the
trafficking in works produced through the exploitation of real children.
The hypothesis is somewhat implausible. If virtual images were identical
to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from
the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would
risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized
images would suffice.

In the case of the material covered by *Ferber,* the creation of the
speech is itself the crime of child abuse; the prohibition deters the
crime by removing the profit motive. See [*Osborne*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Even where there is an underlying crime, however, 
the Court has not allowed the suppression of speech in all cases. *E. g.,* [*Bartnicki,
supra,* at 529](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2171346211086974391&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(market deterrence would not justify law prohibiting a radio commentator
from distributing speech that had been unlawfully intercepted). We need
not consider where to strike the balance in this case, because here,
there is no underlying crime at all. Even if the Government's market
deterrence theory were persuasive in some contexts, it would not justify
this statute.

Finally, the Government says that the possibility of producing images by
using computer imaging makes it very difficult for it to prosecute those
who produce pornography by using real children. Experts, we are told,
may have difficulty in saying whether the pictures were made by using
real children or by using computer imaging. The necessary solution, the
argument runs, is to prohibit both kinds of images. The
argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means
to ban unprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment
upside down.

The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress
unlawful speech. Protected speech does not become unprotected merely
because it resembles the latter. The Constitution requires the reverse.
"[T]he possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to
go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of
others may be muted &hellip;" [*Broadrick* v. *Oklahoma*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The overbreadth doctrine prohibits the Government from banning
unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is
prohibited or chilled in the process.

To avoid the force of this objection, the Government would have us read
the CPPA not as a measure suppressing speech but as a law shifting the
burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful. In this connection,
the Government relies on an affirmative defense under the statute, which
allows a defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by
showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not
otherwise distributed in a manner conveying the impression that they
depicted real children. See 18 U. S. C. § 2252A(c).

The Government raises serious constitutional difficulties by seeking to
impose on the defendant the burden of proving his speech is not
unlawful. An affirmative defense applies only after prosecution has
begun, and the speaker must himself prove, on pain of a felony
conviction, that his conduct falls within the affirmative defense. In
cases under the CPPA, the evidentiary burden is not trivial. Where the
defendant is not the producer of the work, he may have no way of
establishing the identity, or even the existence, of the actors. If the
evidentiary issue is a serious problem for the Government, as it
asserts, it will be at least as difficult  for the innocent
possessor. The statute, moreover, applies to work created before 1996,
and the producers themselves may not have preserved the records
necessary to meet the burden of proof. Failure to establish the defense
can lead to a felony conviction.

We need not decide, however, whether the Government could impose this
burden on a speaker. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute
from First Amendment challenge, here the defense is incomplete and
insufficient, even on its own terms. It allows persons to be convicted
in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in
the production. A defendant charged with possessing, as opposed to
distributing, proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the
film depicts only adult actors. See *ibid.* So while the affirmative
defense may protect a movie producer from prosecution for the act of
distribution, that same producer, and all other persons in the
subsequent distribution chain, could be liable for possessing the
prohibited work. Furthermore, the affirmative defense provides no
protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging, or
through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who
appear to be minors. See *ibid.* In these cases, the defendant can
demonstrate no children were harmed in producing the images, yet the
affirmative defense would not bar the prosecution. For this reason, the
affirmative defense cannot save the statute, for it leaves unprotected a
substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government's interest in
distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones.

In sum, § 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized
in *Ferber* and *Miller,* and the reasons the Government offers in
support of limiting the freedom of speech have no justification in our
precedents or in the law of the First Amendment. The provision abridges
the freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech. For this
reason, it is overbroad and unconstitutional . . . .

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

### Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

In my view, the Government's most persuasive asserted interest 
in support of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) 
is the prosecution rationale---that persons who possess and disseminate 
pornographic images of real children 
may escape conviction by claiming that the images are computer generated, 
thereby raising a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. 
At this time, however, the Government asserts only that defendants *raise* such defenses, 
not that they have done so successfully. 
In fact, the Government points to no case 
in which a defendant has been acquitted based on a "computer-generated images" defense. 
While this speculative interest cannot support the broad reach of the CPPA, 
technology may evolve to the point 
where it becomes impossible to enforce actual child pornography laws 
because the Government cannot prove that certain pornographic images are of real children. 
In the event this occurs, 
the Government should not be foreclosed 
from enacting a regulation of virtual child pornography 
that contains an appropriate affirmative defense 
or some other narrowly drawn restriction.

The Court suggests that the Government's interest 
in enforcing prohibitions against real child pornography 
cannot justify prohibitions on virtual child pornography, 
because "this analysis turns the First Amendment upside down. 
The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech." 
But if technological advances thwart prosecution of "unlawful speech," 
the Government may well have a compelling interest 
in barring or otherwise regulating some narrow category of "lawful speech" 
in order to enforce effectively laws against pornography 
made through the abuse of real children. 
The Court does leave open the possibility 
that a more complete affirmative defense could save a statute's constitutionality, 
implicitly accepting that some regulation of virtual child pornography might be constitutional. 
I would not prejudge, however, 
whether a more complete affirmative defense 
is the only way to narrowly tailor a criminal statute 
that prohibits the possession and dissemination of virtual child pornography. 
Thus, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

### Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting

###### with whom Justice Scalia joins in part

We normally do not strike down a statute on First Amendment grounds
"when a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the
challenged statute." [*Parker* v. *Levy*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7171415278006906954&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) 
(US 1974) ("This Court has &hellip; repeatedly expressed its reluctance to strike down
a statute on its face where there were a substantial number of
situations to which it might be validly applied"). This case should be
treated no differently.

Other than computer-generated images that are virtually
indistinguishable from real children engaged in sexually explicit
conduct, the CPPA can be limited so as not to reach any material that
was not already unprotected before the CPPA. The CPPA's definition of
"sexually explicit conduct" is quite explicit in this regard. It makes
clear that the statute only reaches "visual depictions" of:

> "Actual or simulated . . . sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; . . . bestiality; . . . masturbation; . . . sadistic or masochistic abuse; or . . . lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person." 18 U. S. C. § 2256(2).

The Court and Justice O'Connor suggest that this very graphic
definition reaches the depiction of youthful looking adult actors
engaged in suggestive sexual activity, presumably because the definition
extends to "simulated" intercourse. *Ante,* at 247-248 (majority
opinion); *ante,* at 263 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). Read as a whole, however, I think the definition
reaches only the sort of "hard core of child pornography" that we found
without protection in [*Ferber*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
So construed, the CPPA bans visual depictions of youthful looking adult
actors engaged in *actual* sexual activity; mere *suggestions* of sexual
activity, such as youthful looking adult actors squirming under a
blanket, are more akin to written descriptions than visual depictions,
and thus fall outside the purview of the statute . . . .

Indeed, we should be loath to construe a statute as banning film
portrayals of Shakespearian tragedies, without some indication---from text
or legislative history---that such a result was intended. In fact,
Congress explicitly instructed that such a reading of the CPPA would be
wholly unwarranted. As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has
observed:

> "The legislative record, which makes plain that the [CPPA] was
> intended to target only a narrow class of images---visual depictions
> \`which are virtually indistinguishable to unsuspecting viewers from
> unretouched photographs of actual children engaging in identical
> sexual conduct.' " [*United States* v. *Hilton*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14561000702379646006&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (1999)
> (quoting S. Rep. No. 104-358, pt. I, p. 7 (1996)).

This narrow reading of "sexually explicit conduct" not only accords with
the text of the CPPA and the intentions of Congress; it is exactly how
the phrase was understood prior to the broadening gloss the Court gives
it today. Indeed, had "sexually explicit conduct" been thought to reach
the sort of material the Court says it does, then films such as Traffic
and American Beauty would not have been made the way they were. *Ante,* 
(discussing these films' portrayals of youthful looking adult
actors engaged in sexually suggestive conduct). Traffic won its Academy
Award in 2001. American Beauty won its Academy Award in 2000. But the
CPPA has been on the books, and has been enforced, since 1996. The chill
felt by the Court, ("[F]ew legitimate movie producers . . . 
would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this
law"), has apparently never been felt by those who actually make movies.

To the extent the CPPA prohibits possession 
or distribution of materials that "convey the impression" 
of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct, 
that prohibition can and should be limited to reach 
"the sordid business of pandering" 
which lies outside the bounds of First Amendment protection. [*Ginzburg* v. *United States*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) 
(US 1966) (conduct that "deliberately emphasized the sexually provocative aspects of the work, 
in order to catch the salaciously disposed," 
may lose First Amendment protection); [*United States* v.
*Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.* (Scalia, J.,
dissenting)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (US 2000) (collecting cases). 
This is how the Government asks us to construe the statute &hellip; and it
is the most plausible reading of the text, which prohibits only
materials "*advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed
in such a manner* that conveys the  impression that the material
is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually
explicit conduct." 18 U. S. C. § 2256(8)(D) (emphasis added).

The First Amendment may protect the video shopowner or film distributor 
who promotes material as "entertaining" or "acclaimed" 
regardless of whether the material 
contains depictions of youthful looking adult actors engaged in nonobscene 
but sexually suggestive conduct. 
The First Amendment does not, however, protect the panderer. 
Thus, materials promoted as conveying the impression 
that they depict actual minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct 
do not escape regulation merely because they might warrant First Amendment protection 
if promoted in a different manner. See [*Ginzburg, supra,* at 474-476](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0); 
cf. [*Jacobellis* v. *Ohio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15356452945994377133&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) (US 1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting)
("In my opinion, the use to which various materials are put—not just the words and pictures themselves—must be considered in determining whether or not the materials are obscene"). I would construe "conveys the impression" as limited to the panderer, which makes the statute entirely consistent with *Ginzburg* and other cases.

In sum, while potentially impermissible applications of the CPPA may
exist, I doubt that they would be "substantial &hellip; in relation to the
statute's plainly legitimate sweep." [*Broadrick* 413 U. S., at
615](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375)
The aim of ensuring the enforceability of our Nation's child pornography laws 
is a compelling one. 
The CPPA is targeted to this aim by extending the definition of child pornography 
to reach computer generated images
that are virtually indistinguishable from real children engaged in
sexually explicit conduct. The statute need not be read to do any more
than precisely this, which is not offensive to the First Amendment.

For these reasons, I would construe the CPPA in a manner consistent with
the First Amendment, reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment, and uphold
the statute in its entirety.
