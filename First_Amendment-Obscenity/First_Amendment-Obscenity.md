## First Amendment - Obscenity 

For several decades in the second half of the last century, the Supreme Court was deluged with obscenity cases, clearly a category of unprotected speech. But the problem was defining it.

Justice Potter Stewart gave the most honest and memorable definition in [*Jacobellis v. Ohio* (1964)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio):

> I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ["hard-core pornography"]; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. **But I know it when I see it**, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.

As we'll see later, obscenity trials are almost pass&eacute; because of the advent of the Internet, but obscenity is worth studying because it provides case studies in how legislatures attempt to ban certain categories of speech. If intellectual property is like oil, waiting to gush forth and become valuable, then it's as if the government says: It's against the law for you to drill for certain kinds of speech, or make certain kinds of intellectual property. 

No better example then 2 Live Crew's "Nasty As They Wanna Be."

## Child Pornography 

In [*New York v. Ferber*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_v._Ferber), 58 U.S. 747 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the State of New York could ban the sale of material depicting children engaged in sexual activity. 

Child pornography, the court said, is unprotected speech, not because it is obscene but because actual children are harmed in the making of it, and the resulting product provides a permanent record of the harm done, capable of inflicting grievous damage on child actors long afterwards.

Which raised the question: What about virtual child pornography, in which no actual children are used as actors?

Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.

#### Excerpts from the *Ashcroft* opinion:

We consider in this case whether the Child Pornography Prevention Act of
1996 (CPPA), 18 U. S. C. § 2251 *et seq.,* abridges the freedom of
speech. The CPPA extends the federal prohibition against child
pornography to sexually explicit images that appear to depict minors but
were produced without using any real children. The statute prohibits, in
specific circumstances, possessing or distributing these images, which
may be created by using adults who  look like minors or by using
computer imaging. The new technology, according to Congress, makes it
possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist. See
Congressional Findings, notes following 18 U. S. C. § 2251.

By prohibiting child pornography that does not depict an actual child,
the statute goes beyond [*New York* v. *Ferber,* 458 U. S. 747
(1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
which distinguished child pornography from other sexually explicit
speech because of the State's interest in protecting the children
exploited by the production process. See *id.,* at 758. As a general
rule, pornography can be banned only if obscene, but under *Ferber,*
pornography showing minors can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene under the definition set forth in [*Miller* v. *California,* 413 U. S. 15
(1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
*Ferber* recognized that "[t]he *Miller* standard, like all general
definitions of what may be banned as obscene, does not reflect the
State's particular and more compelling interest in prosecuting those who
promote the sexual exploitation of children." [458 U. S., at
761](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

While we have not had occasion to consider the question, we may assume
that the apparent age of persons engaged in sexual conduct is relevant
to whether a depiction offends community standards. Pictures of young
children engaged in certain acts might be obscene where similar
depictions of adults, or perhaps even older adolescents, would not. The
CPPA, however, is not directed at speech that is obscene; Congress has
proscribed those materials through a separate statute. 18 U. S. C. §§
1460-1466. Like the law in *Ferber,* the CPPA seeks to reach beyond
obscenity, and it makes no attempt to conform to the *Miller* standard.
For instance, the statute would reach visual depictions, such as movies,
even if they have redeeming social value.

The principal question to be resolved, then, is whether the CPPA is
constitutional where it proscribes a significant universe of speech that
is neither obscene under *Miller* nor child pornography under *Ferber.*

####  I

Before 1996, Congress defined child pornography as the type of
depictions at issue in *Ferber,* images made using actual minors.
The CPPA retains that prohibition at 18 U. S.
C. § 2256(8)(A) and adds three other prohibited categories of speech, of
which the first, § 2256(8)(B), and the third, § 2256(8)(D), are at issue
in this case. Section 2256(8)(B) prohibits:

> "any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or
computer-generated image or picture," that "is, or appears to be, of a
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 

The prohibition on "any
visual depiction" does not depend at all on how the image is produced.
The section captures a range of depictions, sometimes called "virtual
child pornography," which include computer-generated images, as well as
images produced by more traditional means. For instance, the literal
terms of the statute embrace a Renaissance painting depicting a scene
from classical mythology, a "picture" that "appears to be, of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct." The statute also prohibits
Hollywood movies, filmed without any child actors, if a jury believes an
actor "appears to be" a minor engaging in "actual or simulated . . .
sexual intercourse." 

These images do not involve, let alone harm, any children in the
production process; but Congress decided the materials threaten children
in other, less direct, ways. Pedophiles might use the materials to
encourage children to participate in sexual activity. "[A] child who is
reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to pose for
sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced by viewing
depictions of other children 'having fun' participating in such
activity." Congressional Finding (3), notes following § 2251.
Furthermore, pedophiles might "whet their own sexual appetites" with the
pornographic images, "thereby increasing the creation and distribution
of child pornography and the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual
children." *Id.,* Findings  (4), (10)(B). Under these
rationales, harm flows from the content of the images, not from the
means of their production. In addition, Congress identified another
problem created by computer-generated images: Their existence can make
it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors. See *id.,*
Finding (6)(A). As imaging technology improves, Congress found, it
becomes more difficult to prove that a particular picture was produced
using actual children. To ensure that defendants possessing child
pornography using real minors cannot evade prosecution, Congress
extended the ban to virtual child pornography.

Section 2256(8)(C) prohibits a more common and lower tech means of
creating virtual images, known as computer morphing. Rather than
creating original images, pornographers can alter innocent pictures of
real children so that the children appear to be engaged in sexual
activity. Although morphed images may fall within the definition of
virtual child pornography, they implicate the interests of real children
and are in that sense closer to the images in *Ferber.* Respondents do
not challenge this provision, and we do not consider it.

Respondents do challenge § 2256(8)(D). Like the text of the "appears to
be" provision, the sweep of this provision is quite broad. Section
2256(8)(D) defines child pornography to include any sexually explicit
image that was:

> "advertised, promoted, presented, described, or
distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression" it depicts "a
minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct." 

One Committee Report
identified the provision as directed at sexually explicit images
pandered as child pornography. 
("This provision prevents child pornographers and pedophiles from
exploiting prurient interests in child sexuality and sexual activity
through the production or distribution of pornographic material which is
intentionally pandered as child pornography"). The statute is not so
limited in its reach, however, as it punishes even  those
possessors who took no part in pandering. Once a work has been described
as child pornography, the taint remains on the speech in the hands of
subsequent possessors, making possession unlawful even though the
content otherwise would not be objectionable.

Fearing that the CPPA threatened the activities of its members,
respondent Free Speech Coalition and others challenged the statute in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. The Coalition, a California trade association for the
adult-entertainment industry, alleged that its members did not use
minors in their sexually explicit works, but they believed some of these
materials might fall within the CPPA's expanded definition of child
pornography. The other respondents are Bold Type, Inc., the publisher of
a book advocating the nudist lifestyle; Jim Gingerich, a painter of
nudes; and Ron Raffaelli, a photographer specializing in erotic images.
Respondents alleged that the "appears to be" and "conveys the
impression" provisions are overbroad and vague, chilling them from
producing works protected by the First Amendment. The District Court
disagreed and granted summary judgment to the Government. The court
dismissed the overbreadth claim because it was "highly unlikely" that
any "adaptations of sexual works like \`Romeo and Juliet,' . . . will be
treated as \`criminal contraband.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a—63a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. See [198 F. 3d 1083
(1999)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The court reasoned that the Government could not prohibit speech because
of its tendency to persuade viewers to commit illegal acts. The court
held the CPPA to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials
that are neither obscene nor produced by the exploitation of real
children as in [*New York* v. *Ferber,* 458 U. S. 747
(1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Judge Ferguson dissented on the ground that virtual images, like
obscenity and real child pornography, should be treated as a category of
speech unprotected by the First Amendment. [198 F. 3d, at
1097](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The Court of Appeals voted to  deny the petition for rehearing
en banc, over the dissent of three judges. See 220 F. 3d 1113 (2000).

While the Ninth Circuit found the CPPA invalid on its face, four other Courts of Appeals have sustained it. 

We granted certiorari. 531 U. S. 1124 (2001).

#### II

The First Amendment commands, "Congress shall make no law . . .
abridging the freedom of speech." The government may violate this
mandate in many ways, *e. g.,* [*Rosenberger* v. *Rector and Visitors of
Univ. of Va.,* 515 U. S. 819
(1995)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5541076601148584638&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
[*Keller* v. *State Bar of Cal.,* 496 U. S. 1
(1990),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15416438635105441831&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
but a law imposing criminal penalties on protected speech is a stark
example of speech suppression. The CPPA's penalties are indeed severe. A
first offender may be imprisoned for 15 years. § 2252A(b)(1). A repeat
offender faces a prison sentence of not less than 5 years and not more
than 30 years in prison. *Ibid.* While even minor punishments can chill
protected speech, see [*Wooley* v. *Maynard,* 430 U. S. 705
(1977),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15210508422263730617&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
this case provides a textbook example of why we permit facial challenges
to statutes that burden expression. With these severe penalties in
force, few legitimate movie producers or book publishers, or few other
speakers in any capacity, would risk distributing images in or near the
uncertain reach of this law. The Constitution gives significant
protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First
Amendment's vast and privileged sphere. Under this principle, the CPPA
is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of
protected expression. See [*Broadrick* v. *Oklahoma,* 413 U. S. 601, 612
(1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).

The sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant
to the moral instincts of a decent people. In  its legislative
findings, Congress recognized that there are subcultures of persons who
harbor illicit desires for children and commit criminal acts to gratify
the impulses. See Congressional Findings, notes following § 2251; see
also U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Administration on
Children, Youth and Families, Child Maltreatment 1999 (estimating that
93,000 children were victims of sexual abuse in 1999). Congress also
found that surrounding the serious offenders are those who flirt with
these impulses and trade pictures and written accounts of sexual
activity with young children.

Congress may pass valid laws to protect children from abuse, and it has.
The prospect of crime, however, by
itself does not justify laws suppressing protected speech. See
[*Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.* v. *Regents of Univ. of N. Y.,* 360 U.
S. 684, 689
(1959)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3228427129910896091&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent
crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not
abridgment of the rights of free speech" (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)). It is also well established that speech may not be
prohibited because it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities. See
[*FCC* v. *Pacifica Foundation,* 438 U. S. 726, 745
(1978)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9738309099999149495&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("[T]he fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient
reason for suppressing it"); see also [*Reno* v. *American Civil
Liberties Union,* 521 U. S. 844, 874
(1997)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1557224836887427725&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("In evaluating the free speech rights of adults, we have made it
perfectly clear that \`[s]exual expression which is indecent but not
obscene is protected by the First Amendment' ") (quoting [*Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc.* v. *FCC,* 492 U. S. 115, 126
(1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959937071120946576&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0));
[*Carey* v. *Population Services Int'l,* 431 U. S. 678, 701
(1977)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4801034783278981738&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("[T]he fact that protected speech may be offensive to some does not
justify its suppression").

As a general principle, the First Amendment bars the government from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear. The freedom of speech has its limits; it does not  embrace certain categories of speech, including defamation, incitement, obscenity, and pornography produced with real children. See [*Simon & Schuster, Inc.* v. *Members of N. Y.* *State Crime Victims Bd.,* 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=988401867966498877&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  While these categories may be prohibited without violating the First Amendment, none of them includes the speech prohibited by the CPPA. In his dissent from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, Judge Ferguson recognized this to be the law and proposed that virtual child pornography should be regarded as an additional category of unprotected speech. See [198 F. 3d, at 1101](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4713588848027905018&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  It would be necessary for us to take this step to uphold the statute.

As we have noted, the CPPA is much more than a supplement to the existing federal prohibition on obscenity. Under [*Miller* v. *California,* 413 U. S. 15 (1973),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) the Government must prove that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. *Id.,* at 24. The CPPA, however, extends to images that appear to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity without regard to the *Miller* requirements. The materials need not appeal to the prurient interest. Any depiction of sexually explicit activity, no matter how it is presented, is proscribed. The CPPA applies to a picture in a psychology manual, as well as a movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse. It is not necessary, moreover, that the image be patently offensive. Pictures of what appear to be 17-year-olds engaging in sexually explicit activity do not in every case contravene community standards.

The CPPA prohibits speech despite its serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value. The statute proscribes the visual
depiction of an idea—that of teenagers engaging in sexual activity—that
is a fact of modern society and has been a theme in art and literature
throughout the ages.  Under the CPPA, images are prohibited so
long as the persons appear to be under 18 years of age.
This is higher than the legal age for marriage in many States,
as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations . . . . 
(48 States permit 16-year-olds to marry with parental consent) . . . . 
(in 39 States and the District of Columbia, the age
of consent is 16 or younger). It is, of course,
undeniable that some youths in sexual activity before the legal age,
either on their own inclination or because they are victims of sexual
abuse.

Both themes--teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of
children--have inspired countless literary works. William Shakespeare
created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13
years of age. See Romeo and Juliet, act I, sc. 2, l. 9 ("She hath not
seen the change of fourteen years"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays
the relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not juvenile.
The work has inspired no less than 40 motion pictures, some of which
suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship. *E.g.,*
Romeo and Juliet (B. Luhrmann director, 1996). Shakespeare may not have
written sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but were
modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach, that fact alone
would not compel the conclusion that the work was obscene.

Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's Academy Awards
featured the movie, Traffic, which was nominated for Best Picture. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16year-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her  to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before, American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the course of the movie, a
teenage girl engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, and
another yields herself to the gratification of a middle-aged man. The
film also contains a scene where, although the movie audience
understands the act is not taking place, one character believes he is
watching a teenage boy performing a sexual act on an older man.

Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring fascination
with the lives and destinies of the young. Art and literature express
the vital interest we all have in the formative years we ourselves once
knew, when wounds can be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and
mistaken choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self-fulfillment are
still in reach. Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA,
they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions.
If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those
subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within
the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to
severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value. This
is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic
merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit
scene. See [*Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"*
v. *Attorney General of Mass.,* 383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966) (plurality
opinion)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10189557359995044131&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("[T]he social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor
canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness"). Under
*Miller,* the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by
considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the
narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even
though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See [*Kois* v.
*Wisconsin,* 408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972)
*(per*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14245554701828404349&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)[*curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14245554701828404349&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
For this reason, and the others we have noted, the CPPA cannot be read
to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its
prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the
definition of obscenity.

The Government seeks to address this deficiency by arguing that speech
prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from child
pornography, which may be banned without regard to whether it depicts
works of value. See [*New York* v. *Ferber,* 458 U. S., at
761](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Where the images are themselves the product of child sexual abuse,
*Ferber* recognized that the State had an interest in stamping it out
without regard to any judgment about its content. See also *id.,* at 775 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("As drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication of
particular ideas"). The production of the work, not its content, was the
target of the statute. The fact that a work contained serious literary,
artistic, or other value did not excuse the harm it caused to its child
participants. It was simply "unrealistic to equate a community's
toleration for sexually oriented materials with the permissible scope of
legislation aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation."

*Ferber* upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale of child
pornography, as well as its production, because these acts were
"intrinsically related" to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. First, as a permanent record of a child's abuse, the
continued circulation itself would harm the child who had participated.
Like a defamatory statement, each new publication of the speech would
cause new injury to the child's reputation and emotional well-being. Second, because the traffic in child
pornography was an economic motive for its production, the State had an
interest in closing the distribution network. "The most expeditious if
not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the
market for this material  by imposing severe criminal penalties
on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product." Under either rationale, the speech had what the Court in
effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came.

Later, in [*Osborne* v. *Ohio,* 495 U. S. 103
(1990),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the Court ruled that these same interests justified a ban on the
possession of pornography produced by using children. "Given the
importance of the State's interest in protecting the victims of child
pornography," the State was justified in "attempting to stamp out this
vice at all levels in the distribution chain." *Id.,* at 110. *Osborne*
also noted the State's interest in preventing child pornography from
being used as an aid in the solicitation of minors. *Id.,* at 111. The
Court, however, anchored its holding in the concern for the
participants, those whom it called the "victims of child pornography."
*Id.,* at 110. It did not suggest that, absent this concern, other
governmental interests would suffice. See *infra,* at 251-253.

In contrast to the speech in *Ferber,* speech that itself is the record
of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and
creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not
"intrinsically related" to the sexual abuse of children, as were the materials in *Ferber.* [458 U. S., at 759](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  While the Government asserts that the images can lead to actual instances of child abuse, see *infra,* at 251-254, the causal link is contingent and indirect. The harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts.

The Government says these indirect harms are sufficient because, as
*Ferber* acknowledged, child pornography rarely can be valuable speech.
See [458 U. S., at
762](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("The value of permitting live performances and photographic
reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly
modest, if not *de minimis* "). This argument, however, suffers from two
flaws. First, *Ferber* \`s judgment  about child pornography was
based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated. The case
reaffirmed that where the speech is neither obscene nor the product of
sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the protection of the First
Amendment. See *id.,* at 764-765 ("[T]he distribution of descriptions or
other depictions of sexual conduct, not otherwise obscene, which do not
involve live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of
live performances, retains First Amendment protection").

The second flaw in the Government's position is that *Ferber* did not
hold that child pornography is by definition without value. On the
contrary, the Court recognized some works in this category might have
significant value, see *id.,* at 761, but relied on virtual images—the
very images prohibited by the CPPA—as an alternative and permissible
means of expression: "[I]f it were necessary for literary or artistic
value, a person over the statutory age who perhaps looked younger could
be utilized. Simulation outside of the prohibition of the statute could
provide another alternative." *Id.,* at 763. *Ferber,* then, not only
referred to the distinction between actual and virtual child
pornography, it relied on it as a reason supporting its holding.
*Ferber* provides no support for a statute that eliminates the
distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as well.

#### III

The CPPA, for reasons we have explored, is inconsistent with *Miller*
and finds no support in *Ferber.* The Government seeks to justify its
prohibitions in other ways. It argues that the CPPA is necessary because
pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children. There
are many things innocent in themselves, however, such as cartoons, video
games, and candy, that might be used for immoral purposes, yet we would
not expect those to be prohibited because they can be misused. The
Government, of course, may punish adults who provide unsuitable
materials  to children, see [*Ginsberg* v. *New York,* 390 U. S.
629
(1968),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
and it may enforce criminal penalties for unlawful solicitation. The
precedents establish, however, that speech within the rights of adults
to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children
from it. See [*Sable Communications of Cal., Inc.* v. *FCC,* 492 U. S.
115
(1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959937071120946576&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
In [*Butler* v. *Michigan,* 352 U. S. 380, 381
(1957),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8098803622147894006&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the Court invalidated a statute prohibiting distribution of an indecent
publication because of its tendency to "\`incite minors to violent or
depraved or immoral acts.' " A unanimous Court agreed upon the important
First Amendment principle that the State could not "reduce the adult
population . . . to reading only what is fit for children." *Id.,* at
383. We have reaffirmed this holding. See [*United States* v. *Playboy
Entertainment Group, Inc.,* 529 U. S. 803, 814
(2000)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("[T]he objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a
blanket ban if the protection can be accomplished by a less restrictive
alternative"); [*Reno* v. *American Civil Liberties Union,* 521 U. S.,
at
875](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1557224836887427725&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(The "governmental interest in protecting children from harmful
materials . . . does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of
speech addressed to adults"); [*Sable Communications* v. *FCC, supra,*
at
130-131](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959937071120946576&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(striking down a ban on "dial-a-porn" messages that had "the invalid
effect of limiting the content of adult telephone conversations to that
which is suitable for children to hear").

Here, the Government wants to keep speech from children not to protect
them from its content but to protect them from those who would commit
other crimes. The principle, however, remains the same: The Government
cannot ban speech fit for adults simply because it may fall into the
hands of children. The evil in question depends upon the actor's
unlawful conduct, conduct defined as criminal quite apart from any link
to the speech in question. This establishes that the speech ban is not
narrowly drawn. The objective is to prohibit illegal conduct, but this
restriction goes well  beyond that interest by restricting the
speech available to law-abiding adults.

The Government submits further that virtual child pornography whets the
appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal
conduct. This rationale cannot sustain the provision in question. The
mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient
reason for banning it. The government "cannot constitutionally premise
legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's private
thoughts." [*Stanley* v. *Georgia,* 394 U. S. 557, 566
(1969)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6728320798248524934&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to
control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end. The
right to think is the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected
from the government because speech is the beginning of thought.

To preserve these freedoms, and to protect speech for its own sake, the
Court's First Amendment cases draw vital distinctions between words and
deeds, between ideas and conduct. See [*Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp.,*
360 U. S., at
689](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3228427129910896091&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
see also [*Bartnicki* v. *Vopper,* 532 U. S. 514, 529
(2001)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2171346211086974391&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("The normal method of deterring unlawful conduct is to impose an
appropriate punishment on the person who engages in it"). The government
may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act
will be committed "at some indefinite future time." [*Hess* v.
*Indiana,* 414 U. S. 105, 108 (1973) *(per
curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4042159652386241321&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
The government may suppress speech for advocating the use of force or a
violation of law only if "such advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action." [*Brandenburg* v. *Ohio,* 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969) *(per
curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*.*
There is here no attempt, incitement, solicitation, or conspiracy. The
Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech
that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse.
Without a significantly stronger, more direct connection, the Government
may not prohibit  speech on the ground that it may encourage
pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.

The Government next argues that its objective of eliminating the market
for pornography produced using real children necessitates a prohibition
on virtual images as well. Virtual images, the Government contends, are
indistinguishable from real ones; they are part of the same market and
are often exchanged. In this way, it is said, virtual images promote the
trafficking in works produced through the exploitation of real children.
The hypothesis is somewhat implausible. If virtual images were identical
to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from
the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would
risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized
images would suffice.

In the case of the material covered by *Ferber,* the creation of the
speech is itself the crime of child abuse; the prohibition deters the
crime by removing the profit motive. See [*Osborne,* 495 U. S., at
109-110](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4775063558409617777&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Even where there is an underlying crime, however, the Court has not
allowed the suppression of speech in all cases. *E. g.,* [*Bartnicki,
supra,* at
529](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2171346211086974391&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(market deterrence would not justify law prohibiting a radio commentator
from distributing speech that had been unlawfully intercepted). We need
not consider where to strike the balance in this case, because here,
there is no underlying crime at all. Even if the Government's market
deterrence theory were persuasive in some contexts, it would not justify
this statute.

Finally, the Government says that the possibility of producing images by
using computer imaging makes it very difficult for it to prosecute those
who produce pornography by using real children. Experts, we are told,
may have difficulty in saying whether the pictures were made by using
real children or by using computer imaging. The necessary solution, the
argument runs, is to prohibit both kinds of images.  The
argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means
to ban unprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment
upside down.

The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress
unlawful speech. Protected speech does not become unprotected merely
because it resembles the latter. The Constitution requires the reverse.
"[T]he possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to
go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of
others may be muted . . . ." [*Broadrick* v. *Oklahoma,* 413 U. S., at
612](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The overbreadth doctrine prohibits the Government from banning
unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is
prohibited or chilled in the process.

To avoid the force of this objection, the Government would have us read
the CPPA not as a measure suppressing speech but as a law shifting the
burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful. In this connection,
the Government relies on an affirmative defense under the statute, which
allows a defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by
showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not
otherwise distributed in a manner conveying the impression that they
depicted real children. See 18 U. S. C. § 2252A(c).

The Government raises serious constitutional difficulties by seeking to
impose on the defendant the burden of proving his speech is not
unlawful. An affirmative defense applies only after prosecution has
begun, and the speaker must himself prove, on pain of a felony
conviction, that his conduct falls within the affirmative defense. In
cases under the CPPA, the evidentiary burden is not trivial. Where the
defendant is not the producer of the work, he may have no way of
establishing the identity, or even the existence, of the actors. If the
evidentiary issue is a serious problem for the Government, as it
asserts, it will be at least as difficult  for the innocent
possessor. The statute, moreover, applies to work created before 1996,
and the producers themselves may not have preserved the records
necessary to meet the burden of proof. Failure to establish the defense
can lead to a felony conviction.

We need not decide, however, whether the Government could impose this
burden on a speaker. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute
from First Amendment challenge, here the defense is incomplete and
insufficient, even on its own terms. It allows persons to be convicted
in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in
the production. A defendant charged with possessing, as opposed to
distributing, proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the
film depicts only adult actors. See *ibid.* So while the affirmative
defense may protect a movie producer from prosecution for the act of
distribution, that same producer, and all other persons in the
subsequent distribution chain, could be liable for possessing the
prohibited work. Furthermore, the affirmative defense provides no
protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging, or
through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who
appear to be minors. See *ibid.* In these cases, the defendant can
demonstrate no children were harmed in producing the images, yet the
affirmative defense would not bar the prosecution. For this reason, the
affirmative defense cannot save the statute, for it leaves unprotected a
substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government's interest in
distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones.

In sum, § 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized
in *Ferber* and *Miller,* and the reasons the Government offers in
support of limiting the freedom of speech have no justification in our
precedents or in the law of the First Amendment. The provision abridges
the freedom to engage in a substantial amount of lawful speech. For this
reason, it is overbroad and unconstitutional . . . .

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

*It is so ordered.*

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

In my view, the Government's most persuasive asserted interest in support of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) is the prosecution rationale--that persons who possess and disseminate pornographic images of real children may escape conviction by claiming that the images are computer generated, thereby raising a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. At this time, however, the Government asserts only that defendants *raise* such defenses, not that they have done so successfully. In fact, the Government points to no case in which a defendant has been acquitted based on a "computer-generated images" defense. While this speculative interest cannot support the broad reach of the CPPA, technology may evolve to the point where it becomes impossible to enforce actual child pornography laws because the Government cannot prove that certain pornographic images are of real children. In the event this occurs, the Government should not be foreclosed from enacting a regulation of virtual child pornography that contains an appropriate affirmative defense or some other narrowly drawn restriction.

The Court suggests that the Government's interest in enforcing prohibitions against real child pornography cannot justify prohibitions on virtual child pornography, because "[t]his analysis turns the First Amendment upside down. The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech." But if technological advances thwart prosecution of "unlawful speech," the Government may well have a compelling interest in barring or otherwise regulating some narrow category of "lawful speech" in order to enforce effectively laws against pornography made through the abuse of real children. The Court does leave open the possibility that a more complete affirmative defense could save a statute's constitutionality, implicitly accepting that some  regulation of virtual child pornography might be constitutional. I would not prejudge, however, whether a more complete affirmative defense is the only way to narrowly tailor a criminal statute that prohibits the possession and dissemination of virtual child pornography. Thus, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

[Justice O'Connor's dissent omitted]

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia joins in part,
dissenting.

We normally do not strike down a statute on First Amendment grounds
"when a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the
challenged statute." [*Parker* v. *Levy,* 417 U. S. 733, 760
(1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7171415278006906954&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("This Court has .. . repeatedly expressed its reluctance to strike down
a statute on its face where there were a substantial number of
situations to which it might be validly applied"). This case should be
treated no differently.

Other than computer-generated images that are virtually
indistinguishable from real children engaged in sexually explicit
conduct, the CPPA can be limited so as not to reach any material that
was not already unprotected before the CPPA. The CPPA's definition of
"sexually explicit conduct" is quite explicit in this regard. It makes
clear that the statute only reaches "visual depictions" of:

> "[A]ctual or simulated . . . sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; . . . bestiality; . . . masturbation; . . . sadistic or masochistic abuse; or . . . lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person." 18 U. S. C. § 2256(2).

 The Court and Justice O'Connor suggest that this very graphic
definition reaches the depiction of youthful looking adult actors
engaged in suggestive sexual activity, presumably because the definition
extends to "simulated" intercourse. *Ante,* at 247-248 (majority
opinion); *ante,* at 263 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). Read as a whole, however, I think the definition
reaches only the sort of "hard core of child pornography" that we found
without protection in [*Ferber, supra,* at 773—
774](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
So construed, the CPPA bans visual depictions of youthful looking adult
actors engaged in *actual* sexual activity; mere *suggestions* of sexual
activity, such as youthful looking adult actors squirming under a
blanket, are more akin to written descriptions than visual depictions,
and thus fall outside the purview of the statute . . . .

Indeed, we should be loath to construe a statute as banning film
portrayals of Shakespearian tragedies, without some indication—from text
or legislative history—that such a result was intended. In fact,
Congress explicitly instructed that such a reading of the CPPA would be
wholly unwarranted. As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has
observed:

> "[T]he legislative record, which makes plain that the [CPPA] was
> intended to target only a narrow class of images—visual depictions
> \`which are virtually indistinguishable to unsuspecting viewers from
> unretouched photographs of actual children engaging in identical
> sexual conduct.' " [*United States* v. *Hilton,* 167 F. 3d 61, 72
> (1999)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14561000702379646006&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
> (quoting S. Rep. No. 104-358, pt. I, p. 7 (1996)).

This narrow reading of "sexually explicit conduct" not only accords with
the text of the CPPA and the intentions of Congress; it is exactly how
the phrase was understood prior to the broadening gloss the Court gives
it today. Indeed, had "sexually explicit conduct" been thought to reach
the sort of material the Court says it does, then films such as Traffic
and American Beauty would not have been made the way they were. *Ante,*
at 247-248 (discussing these films' portrayals of youthful looking adult
actors engaged in sexually suggestive conduct). Traffic won its Academy
Award in 2001. American Beauty won its Academy Award in 2000. But the
CPPA has been on the books, and has been enforced, since 1996. The chill
felt by the Court, *ante,* at 244 ("[F]ew legitimate movie producers . .
. would risk distributing images in or near the uncertain reach of this
law"), has apparently never been felt by those who actually make movies.

To the extent the CPPA prohibits possession or distribution of materials
that "convey the impression" of a child engaged in sexually explicit
conduct, that prohibition can and should be limited to reach "the sordid
business of pandering" which lies outside the bounds of First Amendment
protection. [*Ginzburg* v. *United States,* 383 U. S. 463, 467
(1966)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
*e. g., id.,* at 472 (conduct that "deliberately emphasized the sexually
provocative aspects of the work, in order to catch the salaciously
disposed," may lose First Amendment protection); [*United States* v.
*Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,* 529 U. S. 803, 831-832 (2000)
(Scalia, J.,
dissenting)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(collecting cases). This is how the Government asks us to construe the
statute, Brief for Petitioners 18, and n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, and it
is the most plausible reading of the text, which prohibits only
materials "*advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed
in such a manner* that conveys the  impression that the material
is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually
explicit conduct." 18 U. S. C. § 2256(8)(D) (emphasis added).

The First Amendment may protect the video shopowner or film distributor who promotes material as "entertaining" or "acclaimed" regardless of whether the material contains depictions of youthful looking adult actors engaged in nonobscene but sexually suggestive conduct. The First Amendment does not, however, protect the panderer. Thus, materials promoted as conveying the impression that they depict actual minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct do not escape regulation merely because they might warrant First Amendment protection if promoted in a different manner. See [*Ginzburg, supra,* at 474-476](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404909807077661368&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0); cf. [*Jacobellis* v. *Ohio,* 378 U. S. 184, 201 (1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15356452945994377133&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) ("In my opinion, the use to which various materials are put—not just the words and pictures themselves—must be considered in determining whether or not the materials are obscene"). I would construe "conveys the impression" as limited to the panderer, which makes the statute entirely consistent with *Ginzburg* and other cases.

In sum, while potentially impermissible applications of the CPPA may
exist, I doubt that they would be "substantial. . . inrelation to the
statute's plainly legitimate sweep." [*Broadrick,* 413 U. S., at
615](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15763855873494372375&q=ashcroft+free+speech+coalition&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).  The aim of ensuring the enforceability of our Nation's child pornography laws is a compelling one. The CPPA is targeted to this aim by extending
the definition of child pornography to reach computergenerated images
that are virtually indistinguishable from real children engaged in
sexually explicit conduct. The statute need not be read to do any more
than precisely this, which is not offensive to the First Amendment.

For these reasons, I would construe the CPPA in a manner consistent with
the First Amendment, reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment, and uphold
the statute in its entirety.
