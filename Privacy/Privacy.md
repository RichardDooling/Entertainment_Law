# Privacy Rights 

###### by Richard Dooling

## Invasion of Privacy

Privacy rights come in four different flavors, best described by Justice Louis Brandeis in a famous [1890 Harvard Law Review article][brandeis_article] as "the right to be left alone." 

1. Intrusion - Unreasonable intrusion on personal solitude.
2. Publication of Private Facts - Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.
3. False Light - Presentation of people in a false light in the public eye.
4. Celebrity Publicity Rights - Appropriation of one's name, image, or likeness.

### 1. Intrusion Upon Seclusion

> One who intentionally intrudes, 
> physically or otherwise, 
> upon the solitude or seclusion of another 
> or his private affairs or concerns, 
> is subject to liability to the other 
> for invasion of his privacy, 
> if the intrusion would be highly offensive 
> to a reasonable person.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652B: Intrusion upon Seclusion](http://tinyurl.com/lqqgzng)

### 2. Publication of Private Facts

###### aka Public disclosure of true but embarrassing private facts.

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that:

> (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652D: Publicity Given to Private Life](http://tinyurl.com/njkdaxt)

### 3. False Light

> One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another 
> that places the other before the public in a false light 
> is subject to liability to the other 
> for invasion of his privacy, if:

> (a) the false light in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and
> (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.

[Restatement 2nd of Torts § 652E: Publicity Placing Person in False Light](http://tinyurl.com/lbhzrf5)

False light is a close cousin to defamation, and the two torts are often pled together. In [*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=769+F.2d+1128&appflag=67.12) (7th Cir 1985), Judge Richard Posner explained the difference this way:

> The false-light tort, to the extent distinct from the tort of defamation (but there is indeed considerable overlap), rests on an awareness that people who are made to seem pathetic or ridiculous may be shunned, and not just people who are thought to be dishonest or incompetent or
immoral. 

Defamation focuses on the damage to the plaintiff’s reputation in the community, while false light privacy concentrates on the psychological harm done to the plaintiff from objectionable misrepresentations.

## *Shulman v. Group W. Productions* (CA 1998) 

Please read this case in its entirety. It reads like a law review article on the differences between various privacy rights.

* [case at Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=699835474797912872)
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=955+P.2d+469&appflag=67.12), 955 P.2d 469 (Cal. Sct. 1998).

A medical news team (with a private paramedic and a ride-along cameraman) covered a car crash in which Ruth Shulman was gravely injured. The news team filmed the scene and put a mic on a nurse, who went into the helicopter where Ruth Shulman was being treated for her injuries.

The accident turned Ruth Shulman into a paraplegic. The news team videotaped her saying things like, "I just want to die. I don’t want to go through with this." Shulman was in a state of shock at the accident scene, so she did not recall that her statements were videotaped and recorded.

Three months after the accident, Ruth Shulman watched herself on *On Scene: Emergency Response*, a reality news show. The producers did not use her last name, but Shulman was upset that her comments and images of her were enhanced, and then aired on national television – without her permission. 

Ruth Shulman sued for invasion of privacy. Her case was dismissed when the Superior Court ruled that the media had a First Amendment right to videotape and broadcast the sights and sounds of her ordeal. 

Shulman then appealed to the California Supreme Court. In an important decision for the right of privacy, the Supreme Court found for Ruth Shulman by ruling that the reality TV show producers intruded on Ruth Shulman's right of privacy at the scene of the highway accident by filming and recording her ordeal without her permission.

## Haynes v. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

POSNER, Chief Judge.

Luther Haynes and his wife, Dorothy Haynes née Johnson, appeal from the
dismissal on the defendants' motion for summary judgment of their suit
against Nicholas Lemann, the author of a highly praised, best-selling
book of social and political history called *The Promised Land: The
Great Black Migration and How It Changed America* (1991), and Alfred A.
Knopf, Inc., the book's publisher. The plaintiffs claim that the book
libels Luther Haynes and invades both plaintiffs' right of privacy.
Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity, and the common law of
Illinois is agreed to govern the substantive issues. The appeal presents
difficult issues at the intersection of tort law and freedom of the
press.

Between 1940 and 1970, five million blacks moved from impoverished rural
areas in the South to the cities of the North in search of a better
life. Some found it, and after sojourns of shorter or greater length in
the poor black districts of the cities moved to middle-class areas.
Others, despite the ballyhooed efforts of the federal government,
particularly between 1964 and 1972, to erase poverty and racial
discrimination, remained mired in what has come to be called the "urban
ghetto." *The Promised Land* is a history of the migration. It is not
history as a professional historian, a demographer, or a social
scientist would write it. Lemann is none of these. He is a journalist
and has written a journalistic history, in which the focus is on
individuals whether powerful or representative. In the former group are
the politicians who invented, executed, or exploited the "Great Society"
programs. In the latter are a handful of the actual migrants. Foremost
among these is Ruby Lee Daniels. Her story is the spine of the book. We
are introduced to her on page 7; we take leave of her on page 346,
within a few pages of the end of the text of the book.

When we meet her, it is the early 1940s and she is a young woman picking
cotton on a plantation in Clarksdale, Mississippi. "[B]lack sharecropper
society on the eve of the introduction [in the 1940s] of the mechanical
cotton picker [a major spur to the migration] was the equivalent of
big-city ghetto society today in many ways. It was the national center
of illegitimate childbearing and of the female-headed family." Ruby had
married young, but after her husband had been inducted into the army on
the eve of World War II she had fallen in love with a married man, by
whom she had had a child. The man's wife died and Ruby married him, but
they broke up after a month. Glowing reports from an aunt who had moved
to Chicago persuaded Ruby Daniels to move there in 1946. She found a job
doing janitorial work, but eventually lost the job and went on public
aid. She was unmarried, and had several children, when in 1953 she met
"the most important man in her life." Luther Haynes, born in 1924 or
1925, a sharecropper from Mississippi, had moved to Chicago in an effort
to effect a reconciliation with his wife. The effort had failed. When he
met Ruby Daniels he had a well-paying job in an awning factory. They
lived together, and had children. But then "Luther began to drink too
much. When he drank he got mean, and he and Ruby would get into
ferocious quarrels. He was still working, but he wasn't always bringing
his paycheck home." Ruby got work as a maid. They moved to a poorer part
of the city. The relationship went downhill. "It got to the point where
[Luther] would go out on Friday evenings after picking up his paycheck,
and Ruby would hope he wouldn't come home, because she knew he would be
drunk. On the Friday evenings when he did come home — over the years
Ruby developed a devastating  imitation of Luther, and could
recreate the scene quite vividly — he would walk into the apartment, put
on a record and turn up the volume, and saunter into their bedroom, a
bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other, in the mood for love.
On one such night, Ruby's last child, Kevin, was conceived. Kevin always
had something wrong with him — he was very moody, he was scrawny, and he
had a severe speech impediment. Ruby was never able to find out exactly
what the problem was, but she blamed it on Luther; all that alcohol must
have gotten into his sperm, she said."

Ruby was on public aid, but was cut off when social workers discovered
she had a man in the house. She got a night job. Luther was supposed to
stay with the children while she was at work, especially since they
lived in a dangerous neighborhood; but often when she came home, at 3:00
a.m. or so, she would "find the older children awake, and when she would
ask them if Luther had been there, the answer would be, 'No, ma'am.'"
Ruby's last aid check, arriving providentially after she had been cut
off, enabled the couple to buy a modest house on contract — it "was, by
a wide margin, the best place she had ever lived." But "after only a few
months, Luther ruined everything by going out and buying a brand-new
1961 Pontiac. It meant more to him than the house did, and when they
couldn't make the house payment, he insisted on keeping the car" even
though she hadn't enough money to buy shoes for the children. The family
was kicked out of the house. They now moved frequently. They were
reaching rock bottom. At this nadir, hope appeared in the ironic form of
the Robert Taylor Homes, then a brand-new public housing project, now a
notorious focus of drug addiction and gang violence. Ruby had had an
application for public housing on file for many years, but the housing
authority screened out unwed mothers. Told by a social worker that she
could have an apartment in the Taylor Homes if she produced a marriage
license, she and Luther (who was now divorced from his first wife) were
married forthwith and promptly accepted as tenants. "The Haynes family
chose to rejoice in their good fortune in becoming residents of the
Robert Taylor Homes. As Ruby's son Larry, who was twelve years old at
the time, says, 'I thought that was the beautifullest place in the
world.'"

Even in the halcyon days of 1962, the Robert Taylor Homes were no
paradise. There was considerable crime, and there were gangs, and Ruby's
son Kermit joined one. Kermit was not Luther's son and did not recognize
his authority. The two quarreled a lot. Meanwhile Luther had lost his
job in the awning factory "that he had had for a decade, and then
bounced around a little. He lost jobs because of transportation
problems, because of layoffs, because of a bout of serious illness,
because of his drinking, because he had a minor criminal record (having
been in jail for disorderly conduct following a fight with Ruby), and
because creditors were after him." He resumed "his old habit of not
returning from work on Fridays after he got his paycheck." One weekend
he didn't come home at all. In a search of his things Ruby discovered
evidence that Luther was having an affair with Dorothy Johnson, a former
neighbor. "Luther was not being particularly careful; he saw in Dorothy,
who was younger than Ruby, who had three children compared to Ruby's
eight, who had a job while Ruby was on public aid, the promise of an
escape from the ghetto, and he was entranced." The children discovered
the affair. Kermit tried to strangle Luther. In 1965 Luther moved out
permanently, and eventually he and Ruby divorced.

Ruby remained in the Robert Taylor Homes until 1979, when she moved back
to Clarksdale. She had become eligible for social security in 1978; and
with her surviving children (one of her sons had died, either a suicide
or murdered) now adults, though most of them deeply troubled adults and
Kevin, whom Ruby in a custody proceeding described as retarded, still
living at home, Ruby "is settling into old age with a sense of
contentment about the circumstances she has found." But "there has
always been that nagging sensation of incompleteness, which made itself
felt most directly in her relationships with men."

 After divorcing Ruby, Luther Haynes married Dorothy Johnson.
He is still married to her, "owns a home on the far South Side of
Chicago, and has worked for years as a parking-lot attendant; only
recently have he and Ruby found that they can speak civilly to each
other on the phone."

There is much more to the book than our paraphrase and excerpts—much
about other migrants, about the travails of Ruby's children, about
discrimination against blacks in both the North and the South, and about
the politics of poverty programs in Washington and Chicago. But the
excerpts we have quoted contain all the passages upon which the
Hayneses' lawsuit is founded.

### Defamation

The charge of libel is confined to three statements in the book: that Haynes left his children alone at night when he was supposed to be watching them; that he lost a job or jobs because of drinking; and that he spent money on a car that he should have used to buy shoes for his children. We do not agree with the defendants that the dismissal of the libel claim must be upheld because Haynes has failed to allege pecuniary loss from the alleged libels ("special damages"). The rule in Illinois, which used to be limited to slander cases but has been extended to all defamation cases, [*Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson* (7th Cir.1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2482630921714735229) is that a plaintiff can maintain a suit for defamation without proof of special damages only if the defamatory statement falls into one of four "per se" categories: commission of a crime; infection with a type of communicable disease that could cause the infected person to be shunned; malfeasance or misfeasance in the performance of an office or a job; and (what is closely related, but less redolent of actual misconduct and usable by business firms as well as by workers or professionals) unfitness for one's profession or trade. *Id.* at 267-68; [*Mittelman v.  Witous* (Ill. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13391763345781536115).  The statements that Haynes claims are libelous can be interpreted, though just barely, as implying that he was guilty of criminal neglect of his children and was unable to discharge the duties of at least one of his jobs because of alcohol. Ever since modification of the "innocent construction" doctrine in [*Chapski v. Copley Press* (Ill. 1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13218046548992207255) which left the doctrine meaning merely that a court should not strain to put a defamatory interpretation on an ambiguous statement, Illinois courts (and federal courts when interpreting Illinois law) have
been quick to find implications of criminal conduct or of employee or
business misconduct in statements that might have seemed susceptible of
an interpretation that would have taken them out of the per se
categories. See [*Babb v. Minder* (7th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3037575594865725968) (statement that employee had "mooned" held actionable as an accusation
of the crime of indecent exposure); [*Costello v. Capital Cities
Communications, Inc.* (Ill. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2262435237814463228)
(statement that employee had lied held actionable as implying lack of
integrity in performance of duties); 
[*Crinkley v. Dow Jones & Co.*(Ill.App.3d 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10602561162619040127&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(statement alleging payoffs to agents of foreign governments held
actionable); [*Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson* (7th Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2482630921714735229)
(allegations that cigarette company attempted through its advertising to
entice children to smoke held actionable).

The requirement of proving special damages does prevent Haynes from
basing a libel claim on two other statements in the book that he
contends are false: that his drinking was responsible for Kevin's
defects and that his motives for leaving Ruby for Dorothy were
financial. (The second is an implication rather than an outright
statement, but we shall give Haynes the benefit of the doubt and assume
with him that the book implies that his motives were financial rather
than—an interpretation that the passage also supports, and that the
innocent-construction rule, even in its tempered form after *Chapski,*
might therefore require be placed on it — a more diffuse hope of
betterment.) These statements are not within any of the per se
categories and therefore are not actionable, because Haynes alleges no
pecuniary injury.  They probably would be nonactionable in any
event as obvious statements of opinion (Ruby's and Lemann's
respectively) rather than of fact. A statement of fact is not shielded
from an action for defamation by being prefaced with the words "in my
opinion," but if it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective
view, an interpretation, a theory, conjecture, or surmise, rather than
claiming to be in possession of objectively verifiable facts, the
statement is not actionable. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.* (S.Ct. 1990)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7582860956470530700);

The facts about Kevin's condition and about the respective financial
circumstances of Ruby and Dorothy were uncontested, and Ruby and Lemann
were entitled to their interpretation of them. Luther drank heavily; the
proposition that a man's heavy drinking can, and that Luther's heavy
drinking did, damage a fetus is represented in the book merely as Ruby's
conjecture. A reasonable reader would not suppose that she had proof, or
even the scientific knowledge that might ground a reasonable inference.
As for Luther's motives for leaving Ruby for Dorothy, they can never be
known for sure (even by Luther) and anyone is entitled to speculate on a
person's motives from the known facts of his behavior. Luther Haynes
left a poor woman for a less poor one, and Lemann drew a natural though
not inevitable inference. He did not pretend to have the inside dope. He
and Ruby claim insight, not information that the plaintiff might be able
to prove false in a trial.

Lemann's source for the only statements upon which Luther Haynes can
base his claim for defamation, as for most of the rest of what he wrote
about Haynes, was Ruby Daniels. He had interviewed Haynes as well, but
Haynes in his deposition denied that Lemann had questioned him about his
relationship with Ruby. Haynes swears that he never left his children
alone in a dangerous neighborhood when he was supposed to be with them,
did not by his expenditures on the Pontiac deprive his children of
shoes, and was fired not for drinking but because he had been given a
bottle of liquor by a friend which was found unopened in his pocket by
his supervisor; since his job was that of an armed security guard, the
supervisor was unwilling to take a chance on the truthfulness of his
story. Haynes's version of how he lost a job because of "drinking" is
corroborated by Lemann's notes of his interview with Haynes, but is not
mentioned in the book.

It would take a trial to decide whether Ruby Daniels (and hence Nicholas
Lemann) or Luther Haynes should be believed on these three matters. But
the district judge was nevertheless correct to dismiss the defamation
claim because if the gist of a defamatory statement is true, if in other
words the statement is substantially true, error in detail is not
actionable (citations omitted). 

To evaluate the application of this rule to Haynes's libel claims
requires us to consider facts brought out in discovery and not
contested, although they are not in the book. Haynes in his deposition
admitted to drinking heavily during the period when he lost his job
because of the unopened liquor bottle in his pocket. He admitted to
being arrested and jailed for assaulting a police officer after
drinking. When he walked out on Ruby he also walked out on his four
children by her, and he refused to support  them. She was
forced to obtain court orders for child support. Haynes repeatedly
flouted the orders and eventually was jailed for contempt. During their
divorce proceedings it came out that, after leaving Ruby, he and Dorothy
Johnson had had a marriage ceremony and he had entered their names in
the marriage registry of the county clerk's office —two years before his
divorce from Ruby.

Beside these uncontested facts — not to mention the facts about Haynes
in the book that he does not contend are false — the alleged falsehoods
pale. They do not exhibit him in a worse light than a bare recitation of
the uncontested facts about his behavior in relation to Ruby and her
children would do. For Lemann left out much that was true. He did not
mention the bigamous marriage, the repeated flouting of child-support
orders, the arrest for assaulting a police officer, or the jailing for
contempt. Substitute the true for the false (if Haynes is believed), and
the damage to Haynes's reputation would be no less.

The rule of substantial truth is based on a recognition that falsehoods
which do no *incremental* damage to the plaintiff's reputation do not
injure the only interest that the law of defamation protects. A news
report that contains a false statement is actionable "only when
'significantly greater opprobrium' results from the report containing
the falsehood than would result from the report without the falsehood."
[*Herron v. King Broadcasting Co., supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17202290302354597366).
Even when the plaintiff in a defamation suit is not a public figure, the
Supreme Court insists in the name of the First Amendment that unless the
author is deliberately lying or is recklessly indifferent to the truth
or falsity of what he says (neither is a plausible hypothesis here), the
plaintiff must prove actual though not necessarily pecuniary harm in
order to recover damages. [*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202).
Falsehoods that do not harm the plaintiff's reputation more than a full
recital of the true facts about him would do are thus not actionable.
The rule making substantial truth a complete defense and the
constitutional limitations on defamation suits coincide.

Ordinarily the question whether a defamatory work is substantially true
although erroneous in some details is for the jury. [*Kohn v. West
Hawaii Today, Inc.,* (HW 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18205638400160040600).
But no reasonable jury, even if it believed Luther Haynes over Ruby
Daniels on every issue on which they differ, could find that *The
Promised Land* was not substantially true in its depiction of Luther at
the time he lived with Ruby. He *was* a heavy drinker, a bad husband, a
bad father, an erratic employee. These are things either that he
concedes or that are incontestably established by the judicial records
in his matrimonial litigation. Whether he left the children alone at
night on some occasions when Ruby was working, or was fired for drinking
rather than for having liquor on his person while working, or preferred
to spend money on his car than on his children's shoes, are details
that, while not trivial, would not if corrected have altered the picture
that the true facts paint. And it makes no difference that the true
facts were unknown until the trial. A person does not have a legally
protected right to a reputation based on the concealment of the truth.
This is implicit in the rule that truth — not just known truth (see
*Restatement (Second) of Torts* § 581A, comment h (1977); *Prosser and
Keeton on the Law of Torts* § 116, at pp. 840-41 (5th ed. 1984)) — is a
complete defense to defamation. And the burden of proving falsity rests
on the plaintiff. [*Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps* (S.Ct. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3066699330828671613) 

We must be careful, however, that we are not construing the gist of the
allegedly defamatory statements so broadly as to invite defendants to
commit, in effect, a further but privileged libel, by bringing to light
every discreditable act that the plaintiff may have committed, in an
effort to show that he is as "bad" as the defamatory statements depict
him. This would strip people who had done bad things of any legal
protection against being defamed; they would be defamation outlaws. The
true damaging facts must be closely related to the false ones. But that
 test is satisfied. Luther abandoned his children and was
eventually jailed for doing so. These truths encompass and transcend
what, whether or not it might be elevated to criminal neglect, is, after
all, common enough — leaving children, some of them teenagers,
unattended late at night. (And how different is that from leaving a
child at night with a teenage babysitter?) An armed security guard who
is discovered by his employer to have a bottle of liquor in his pocket
is equivalent in irresponsible employee conduct to an ordinary worker
found drinking on the job. And a decision to spend money on a car rather
than on one's children's clothes is subsumed by total financial
abandonment of one's children in violation of court orders, an
abandonment compounded by a bigamous marriage to a woman who herself had
children. The allegedly false facts about Luther were variants of the
true that did not paint him in a worse light. Corresponding to the
"immaterial error[s]" of which the substantial-truth cases speak,
[*Sivulich v. Howard Publications, Inc.,* 126 Ill.App.3d 129, 81 Ill.
Dec. 416, 418, 466 N.E.2d 1218, 1220
(1984),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15779388720675284227&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the alleged falsehoods were merely illustrations of undoubted truths
about Luther Haynes's character at the time, illustrations that even if
false in detail conveyed an accurate impression. They were therefore
substantially true within the meaning which this term must bear to make
sense of the cases.

### Invasion of Privacy

The major claim in the complaint, and the focus of the appeal, is not
defamation, however; it is invasion of the right of privacy. In tort law
the term "right of privacy" covers several distinct wrongs. Using a
celebrity's (or other person's) name or picture in advertising without
his consent. [*Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc.,* (6th
Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18021528625868373370);
[*Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Social Change, Inc. v. American
Heritage Products, Inc.,* (GA 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1102676940012657150);
[*Haelan Laboratories v. Topps Chewing Gum* (2d Cir. 1953)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18211552832825571674);
[*Douglass v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.* (7th Cir. 1985)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17887957795289404111).
Tapping someone's phone, or otherwise invading a person's private space.
[*De May v. Roberts* (MI 1881)] (many citations omitted); 

Harassing a celebrity by following her too closely, albeit on a public street. Cf. [*Galella v. Onassis* (2d Cir. 1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1876391558280554729). Casting a person in a false light by publicizing details of the person's life that while true are so selected or highlighted as to convey a misleading impression of the person's character. [*Time, Inc. v. Hill* (S.Ct. 1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13178370409068522665).  Publicizing personal facts that while true and not misleading are so intimate that their disclosure to the public is deeply embarrassing to the person thus exposed and is perceived as gratuitous by the community (many citations omitted).

The last, the publicizing of personal facts, is the aspect of invasion of privacy charged by the Hayneses.

Even people who have nothing rationally to be ashamed of can be
mortified by the publication of intimate details of their life. Most
people in no wise deformed or disfigured would nevertheless be deeply
upset if nude photographs of themselves were published in a newspaper or
a book. They feel the same way about photographs of their sexual
activities, however "normal," or about a narrative of those activities,
or about having their medical records publicized. Although it is well
known that every human being defecates, no adult human being in our
society wants a newspaper to show a picture of him defecating. The
desire for privacy illustrated by these examples is a mysterious but
deep fact about human personality. It deserves and in our society
receives legal protection. The nature of the injury shows, by the way,
that the defendants are wrong to argue that this branch of the right of
privacy requires proof of special damages. 

But this is not the character of the depictions of the Hayneses in *The
Promised Land.* Although the plaintiff's claim that the book depicts
their "sex life" and "ridicules" Luther Haynes's lovemaking (the
reference is to the passage we quoted in which the author refers to
Ruby's "devastating imitation" of Luther's manner when he would come
home Friday nights in an amorous mood), these characterizations are
misleading. No sexual act is described in the book. No intimate details
are revealed. Entering one's bedroom with a bottle in one hand and a
cigarette in the other is not foreplay. Ruby's speculation that Kevin's
problems may have been due to Luther's having been a heavy drinker is
not the narration of a sexual act.

We said that proof of special damages is not required in a case in which
the public revelation of personal facts is claimed to be an invasion of
privacy. Even so, a plaintiff is not allowed to evade the rule that
requires proof of such damages in defamation cases (outside the per se
categories) by attempting to prove that some of the personal facts
publicized about him are false, unless he is prepared to prove special
damages — and perhaps, as we are about to see, there is no "unless."
Haynes denies that his drinking had anything to do with his son Kevin's
defects or that he was actuated by mercenary considerations in leaving
Ruby for Dorothy. These denials, we have seen, could not be made the
basis of a libel case in the absence of proof of special damages, here
lacking. No more, we think, can they be used to enhance a privacy case,
whether it is a false-light case, [*Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v.
Jacobson, supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2482630921714735229)

See generally [*Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra,* § 652E, comment e.](http://tinyurl.com/lbhzrf5) Indeed, that type of case presupposes the truth of the facts disclosed.
*Id.* If they are false, the interest invaded is that protected by the
defamation and false-light torts: the interest in being represented
truthfully to the world.

Absence of special damages may be the reason why the Hayneses have not
appealed the dismissal of their claim that the defendants cast Luther in
a false light — though in fairness to him we should point out that they
may have placed him in a false light with respect to his motives for
leaving Ruby. Lemann's interview notes suggest (as the book does not, at
least not clearly) that the major difference which Haynes perceived
between the two women was one of character rather than of financial
wherewithal. According to the notes, Haynes told Lemann that Ruby "never
wanted to work. She wanted to sit around and be on aid. I called Ruby
and asked her why she let 'Nita [their daughter] have a baby and she
said, She's grown. I couldn't handle that talk, so I said forget it.
Ruby was on aid when I met her, and she wanted to have more kids so she
could have more aid. Dorothy had three kids, and a job."

This is an aside. The branch of privacy law that the Hayneses invoke in
their appeal is not concerned with, and is not a proper surrogate for
legal doctrines that are concerned with, the accuracy of the private
facts revealed. It is concerned with the propriety of stripping away the
veil of privacy with which we cover the embarrassing, the shameful, the
tabooed, truths about us. [*Leidholdt v. L.F.P. Inc., supra,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15529001075929717432).
The revelations in the book are not about the intimate details of the
Hayneses' life. They are about misconduct, in particular Luther's.
(There is very little about Dorothy in the book, apart from the fact
that she had had an affair with Luther while he was still married to
Ruby and that they eventually became and have remained lawfully
married.) The revelations are about his heavy drinking, his unstable
employment, his adultery, his irresponsible and neglectful behavior
toward his wife and children. So we must consider cases in which the
right of privacy has been invoked as a shield against the revelation of
previous misconduct.

 Two early cases illustrate the range of judicial thinking. In
[*Melvin v. Reid,* 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 Pac. 91
(1931),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the plaintiff was a former prostitute, who had been prosecuted but
acquitted of murder. She later had married and (she alleged) for seven
years had lived a blameless respectable life in a community in which her
lurid past was unknown — when all was revealed in a movie about the
murder case which used her maiden name. The court held that these
allegations stated a claim for invasion of privacy. The Hayneses' claim
is similar although less dramatic. They have been a respectable married
couple for two decades. Luther's alcohol problem is behind him. He has
steady employment as a doorman. His wife is a nurse, and in 1990 he told
Lemann that the couple's combined income was $60,000 a year. He is not
in trouble with the domestic relations court. He is a deacon of his
church. He has come a long way from sharecropping in Mississippi and
public housing in Chicago and he and his wife want to bury their past
just as Mrs. Melvin wanted to do and in [*Melvin v.
Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) was held entitled to do. 

In Luther Haynes's own words, from his deposition, "I know I haven't
been no angel, but since almost 30 years ago I have turned my life
completely around. I stopped the drinking and all this bad habits and
stuff like that, which I deny, some of [it] I didn't deny, because I
have changed my life. It take me almost 30 years to change it and I am
deeply in my church. I look good in the eyes of my church members and my
community. Now, what is going to happen now when this public reads this
garbage which I didn't tell Mr. Lemann to write? Then all this is going
to go down the drain. And I worked like a son of a gun to build myself
up in a good reputation and he has torn it down."

But with [*Melvin v.
Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
compare [*Sidis v. F-R Publishing Corp.,* 113 F.2d 806 (2d Cir.
1940),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14505170794897587048&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
another old case but one more consonant with modern thinking about the
proper balance between the right of privacy and the freedom of the
press. A child prodigy had flamed out; he was now an eccentric recluse.
The *New Yorker* ran a "where is he now" article about him. The article,
entitled "April Fool," did not reveal any misconduct by Sidis but it
depicted him in mocking tones as a comical failure, in much the same way
that the report of Ruby's "devastating imitation" of the amorous Luther
Haynes could be thought to have depicted him as a comical failure,
albeit with sinister consequences absent from Sidis's case. The invasion
of Sidis's privacy was palpable. But the publisher won. No intimate
physical details of Sidis's life had been revealed; and on the other
side was the undoubted newsworthiness of a child prodigy, as of a woman
prosecuted for murder. Sidis, unlike Mrs. Melvin, was not permitted to
bury his past.

Evolution along the divergent lines marked out by *Melvin* and *Sidis*
continued &hellip; until [*Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn* (S.Ct. 1975),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7693360934058091897)
which may have consigned the entire *Melvin* line to the outer darkness.
A Georgia statute forbade the publication of names of rape victims. A
television station obtained the name of a woman who had been raped and
murdered from the indictment of her assailants (a public document), and
broadcast it in defiance of the statute. The woman's father brought a
tort suit against the broadcaster, claiming that the broadcast had
violated his right of privacy. The broadcaster argued that the name of
the woman was a matter of public concern, but the Georgia supreme court
held that the statute established the contrary, and affirmed a finding
of liability. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute
violated the First Amendment. The Court declined to rule whether the
publication of truthful information can ever be made the basis of a tort
suit for invasion of privacy, but held that the First Amendment creates
a privilege to publish matters contained in public records even
 if publication would offend the sensibilities of a reasonable
person. Years later the Court extended the rule laid down in *Cox* to a
case in which a newspaper published a rape victim's name (again in
violation of a state statute) that it had obtained from a police report
that was not a public document. [*Florida Star v. B.J.F.* (S.Ct. 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11083261902857685106).
Again the Court was careful not to hold that states can never provide a
tort remedy to a person about whom truthful, but intensely private,
information of some interest to the public is published. 

We do not think the Court was being coy in *Cox* or *Florida Star* in
declining to declare the tort of publicizing intensely personal facts
totally defunct. (Indeed, the author of *Cox* dissented in *Florida
Star.*) The publication of facts in a public record or other official
document, such as the police report in the *Florida Star,* is not to be
equated to publishing a photo of a couple making love or of a person
undergoing some intimate medical procedure; we even doubt that it would
make a difference in such a case if the photograph had been printed in a
government document (say the patient's file in a Veterans Administration
hospital).

Yet despite the limited scope of the holdings of *Cox* and *Florida
Star,* the implications of those decisions for the branch of the right
of privacy that limits the publication of private facts are profound,
even for a case such as this in which, unlike [*Melvin v.
Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*,*
the primary source of the allegedly humiliating personal facts is not a
public record. (The primary source is Ruby Daniels.) The Court must
believe that the First Amendment greatly circumscribes the right even of
a private figure to obtain damages for the publication of newsworthy
facts about him, even when they are facts of a kind that people want
very much to conceal. To be identified in the newspaper as a rape victim
is intensely embarrassing. And it is not invited embarrassment. No one
asks to be raped; the plaintiff in [*Melvin v. Reid*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=338586778440139438&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
did not ask to be prosecuted for murder (remember, she was acquitted,
though whether she actually was innocent is unknown); Sidis did not
decide to be a prodigy; and Luther Haynes did not aspire to be a
representative figure in the great black migration from the South to the
North. People who do not desire the limelight and do not deliberately
choose a way of life or course of conduct calculated to thrust them into
it nevertheless have no legal right to extinguish it if the experiences
that have befallen them are newsworthy, even if they would prefer that
those experiences be kept private. The possibility of an involuntary
loss of privacy is recognized in the modern formulations of this branch
of the privacy tort, which require not only that the private facts
publicized be such as would make a reasonable person deeply offended by
such publicity but also that they be facts in which the public has no
legitimate interest. *Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra,* § 652D(b).

The two criteria, offensiveness and newsworthiness, are related. An
individual, and more pertinently perhaps the community, is most offended
by the publication of intimate personal facts when the community has no
interest in them beyond the voyeuristic thrill of penetrating the wall
of privacy that surrounds a stranger. The reader of a book about the
black migration to the North would have no legitimate interest in the
details of Luther Haynes's sex life; but no such details are disclosed.
Such a reader does have a legitimate interest in the aspects of Luther's
conduct that the book reveals. For one of Lemann's major themes is the
transposition virtually intact of a sharecropper morality characterized
by a family structure "matriarchal and elastic" and by an "extremely
unstable" marriage bond to the slums of the northern cities, and the
interaction, largely random and sometimes perverse, of that morality
with governmental programs to alleviate poverty. Public aid policies
discouraged Ruby and Luther from living together; public housing
policies precipitated a marriage  doomed to fail. No detail in
the book claimed to invade the Hayneses' privacy is not germane to the
story that the author wanted to tell, a story not only of legitimate but
of transcendent public interest.

The Hayneses question whether the linkage between the author's theme and
their private life really is organic. They point out that many social
histories do not mention individuals at all, let alone by name. That is
true. Much of social science, including social history, proceeds by
abstraction, aggregation, and quantification rather than by case
studies; the economist Robert Fogel has won a Nobel prize for his
statistical studies of economic history, including, not wholly unrelated
to the subject of Lemann's book, the history of Negro slavery in the
United States. But it would be absurd to suggest that cliometric or
other aggregative, impersonal methods of doing social history are the
only proper way to go about it and presumptuous to claim even that they
are the best way. Lemann's book has been praised to the skies by
distinguished scholars, among them black scholars covering a large
portion of the ideological spectrum — Henry Louis Gates Jr., William
Julius Wilson, and Patricia Williams. Lemann's methodology places the
individual case history at center stage. If he cannot tell the story of
Ruby Daniels without waivers from every person who she thinks did her
wrong, he cannot write this book.

Well, argue the Hayneses, at least Lemann could have changed their
names. But the use of pseudonyms would not have gotten Lemann and Knopf
off the legal hook. The details of the Hayneses' lives recounted in the
book would identify them unmistakably to anyone who has known the
Hayneses well for a long time (members of their families, for example),
or who knew them before they got married; and no more is required for
liability either in defamation law (citations omitted).

Lemann would have had to change some, perhaps many, of the details. But
then he would no longer have been writing history. He would have been
writing fiction. The nonquantitative study of living persons would be
abolished as a category of scholarship, to be replaced by the
sociological novel. That is a genre with a distinguished history
punctuated by famous names, such as Dickens, Zola, Stowe, Dreiser,
Sinclair, Steinbeck, and Wolfe, but we do not think that the law of
privacy makes it (or that the First Amendment would permit the law of
privacy to make it) the exclusive format for a social history of living
persons that tells their story rather than treating them as data points
in a statistical study. Reporting the true facts about real people is
necessary to "obviate any impression that the problems raised in the
[book] are remote or hypothetical." [*Gilbert v. Medical Economics Co.,
supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17792839258786586792).
And surely a composite portrait of ghetto residents would be attacked as
racial stereotyping.

*The Promised Land* does not afford the reader a titillating glimpse of
tabooed activities. The tone is decorous and restrained. Painful though
it is for the Hayneses to see a past they would rather forget brought
into the public view, the public needs the information conveyed by the
book, including the information about Luther and Dorothy Haynes, in
order to evaluate the profound social and political questions that the
book raises. Given the *Cox* decision, moreover, all the discreditable
facts about the Hayneses that are contained in judicial records are
beyond the power of tort law to conceal; and the disclosure of those
facts alone would strip away the Hayneses' privacy as effectively as
*The Promised Land* has done. (This *case,* it could be argued, has
stripped them of their privacy, since their story is now part of a
judicial record — the record of this case.) We do not think it is an
answer that Lemann got his facts from Ruby Daniels rather than from
judicial records. The courts got the facts from Ruby. We cannot see what
difference it makes that Lemann went to the source.

Ordinarily the evaluation and comparison of offensiveness and newsworthiness would be, like other questions of the application of a legal standard to the facts of a particular case, matters for a jury, not for a judge on a motion for summary judgment.  But summary judgment is properly granted to a defendant when on the basis of the evidence obtained in pretrial discovery no reasonable jury could render a verdict for the plaintiff, [*Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.* (S.Ct. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9272001251064530131&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) and that is the situation here. No modern cases decided after *Cox,* and precious few before, go as far as the plaintiffs would have us go in this case. Almost all the recent cases on which they rely &hellip; involve the vindication of paramount social interests, such as the protection of children, patients, and witnesses — interests not involved in this case. The plaintiffs' best post-*Cox* cases are [*Vassiliades v.  Garfinckel's, supra*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12881988089288894231) and [*Huskey v. National Broadcasting Co.* (N.D.Ill.1986),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18021807458979528821&q=haynes+alfred+knopf&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0) the former involving before-and-after photos of a face lift, the latter involving television pictures of a prisoner dressed only in gym shorts.  Photographic invasions of privacy usually are more painful than narrative ones, and even partial nudity is a considerable aggravating factor. *Vassiliades* also involved the special issue of patient rights, though it was not emphasized by the court.

Illinois has been a follower rather than a leader in recognizing claims of invasion of privacy (citations omitted). The plaintiffs are asking us to innovate boldly in the name of the Illinois courts, and such a request is better addressed to those courts than to a federal court. If the plaintiffs had filed this case in an Illinois state court and it had been removed to the federal district court, they would have had no choice, and then we would have been duty-bound to be as innovative as we thought it plausible to suppose the Illinois courts would be. But the plaintiffs filed this suit in the district court originally — they *chose* the federal forum. And we have said before and will say again that plaintiffs who seek innovations in state law are ill advised to choose a federal court as their forum.

To any suggestion that the outer bounds of liability should be left to a
jury to decide we reply that in cases involving the rights protected by
the speech and press clauses of the First Amendment the courts insist on
firm judicial control of the jury. For the general principle, see [*New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (S.Ct. 1964)][sullivan].

The publication of books is not at the sufferance of juries.

Does it follow, as the Hayneses' lawyer asked us rhetorically at oral
argument, that a journalist who wanted to write a book about
contemporary sexual practices could include the intimate details of
named living persons' sexual acts without the persons' consent? Not
necessarily, although the revelation of such details in the memoirs of
former spouses and lovers is common enough and rarely provokes a lawsuit
even when the former spouse or lover is still alive. The core of the
branch of privacy law with which we have been dealing in this case is
the protection of those intimate physical details the publicizing of
which would be not merely embarrassing  and painful but deeply
shocking to the average person subjected to such exposure. The public
has a legitimate interest in sexuality, but that interest may be
outweighed in such a case by the injury to the sensibilities of the
persons made use of by the author in such a way. *Restatement (Second)
of Torts, supra,* § 652D, comment h. At least the balance would be
sufficiently close to preclude summary judgment for the author and
publisher (citations omitted). 

The judgment for the defendants is

AFFIRMED.

Actual malice is different from common law malice which indicates spite or ill-will. It may also differ from "actual malice" as defined in state libel law, as was confirmed in the case of Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc. (1983). Also see HERBERT v. LANDO, (1979) 441 U.S. 153 (1979)441 U.S. 153 fn 12; "The existence of actual malice may be shown in many ways. As a general rule, any competent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, can be resorted to, and all the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction may be shown, provided they are not too remote, including threats, prior or subsequent defamations, subsequent statements of the defendant, circumstances indicating the existence of rivalry, ill will, or hostility between the parties, facts tending to show a reckless disregard of the plaintiff's rights..."


To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, we hold that the common-law presumption that defamatory speech is false cannot stand when a plaintiff seeks damages against a media defendant.
