## First Amendment - Violence

If speech is just too "sexy," it can be banned. If its indecent, it can be regulated. But what if speech is just too violent?  What if your client's rap song arguably "inspires" or ["causes" somebody to shoot a cop?](http://thediscography.org/discoDbDetail.php?req=942)  Or your client's lurid magazine article about erotic asphyxiation arguably “causes” somebody to try it out for themselves, [accidentally hanging themselves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_asphyxiation). At trial the victim's family argues that your client's lurid article about erotic asphyxiation was really just a how-to for teenage thrill-seekers. 

What if Subliminal lyrics in your heavy metal song arguably "cause" somebody to commit suicide?  Or your violent video game arguably "causes" or "inspires" a school shooting? 

Shall we allow the family members of these victims to sue you in tort for indirectly "causing" the death of their loved ones? Fourteen different murderers have said that Oliver Stone’s *Natural Born Killers* [inspired them to go on crime sprees of their own][nbk]. 

What if somebody hires you to make a documentary about the production and sale of so-called ["crush videos"][stevens] wherein animals are brutally tortured and killed? Do these cruel and sometimes deadly side effects of violent "speech" suggest that extreme violence should be banned or regulated the way obscenity is banned and regulated?

Do we need a [*Miller* test][miller_test] for violence?  If regulation is required, who should regulate? The government? Industry groups, like the [Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)][mpaa] or the [Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB)][esrb]? Or shall we allow civil liability in the form of tort suits against content providers who publish material that arguably amounts to incitement to violence?

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

We consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent
video games comports with the First Amendment.

### I

[A California statute] prohibits the sale or rental of "violent video games"
to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled "18." The Act
covers games "in which the range of options available to a player
includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image
of a human being, if those acts are depicted" in a manner that:

> "[a] reasonable person, considering the game as a whole, would find appeals
to a deviant or morbid interest of minors," that is "patently offensive
to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for
minors," and that "causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for
minors." 

Violation of the Act is punishable by a civil fine of up to \$1,000.

Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries,
brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California. That court
concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently
enjoined its enforcement. [*Video Software Dealers Assn. v.
Schwarzenegger*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18016190414381938126&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) &hellip;  The Court of Appeals affirmed, [*Video Software Dealers Assn. v.  Schwarzenegger,* 556 F.3d 950 (C.A.9 2009),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18016190414381938126&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) and we granted certiorari &hellip; 

## II

California correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First
Amendment protection. The Free Speech Clause exists principally to
protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it
is difficult to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous
to try. "Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through
fiction. What is one man's amusement, teaches another's doctrine."
[*Winters v. New York,* 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840
(1948)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16314089118204976902&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video
games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar
literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and
through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's
interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First
Amendment protection. Under our Constitution, "esthetic and moral
judgments about art and literature &hellip; are for the individual to make,
not for the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a
majority." [*United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,* 529
U.S. 803, 818, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865
(2000)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
And whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to
ever-advancing technology, "the basic principles of freedom of speech
and the press, like the First Amendment's command, do not vary" when a
new and different medium for communication appears. [*Joseph Burstyn,
Inc. v. Wilson,* 343 U.S. 495, 503, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098
(1952)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5628256980652867975&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
 
The most basic of those principles is this: "[A]s a general matter &hellip; government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,
its ideas, its subject matter, or its content." [*Ashcroft v. American
Civil Liberties Union,* 535 U.S. 564, 573, 122 S.Ct. 1700, 152 L.Ed.2d 771
(2002)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8027362013479204062&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0). There are of course exceptions.
"'From 1791 to the present,' &hellip; the First Amendment has 'permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,' and has
never 'include[d] a freedom to disregard these traditional
limitations.'" [*United States v. Stevens,* (Sct. 2010)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=85657697512539256&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
(quoting [*R.A.V. v. St. Paul,* 505 U.S. 377, 382-383, 112 S.Ct. 2538,
120 L.Ed.2d 305
(1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14621372290934958371&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)).
These limited areas—such as obscenity, [*Roth v. United States,* 354
U.S. 476, 483, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14778925784015245625&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
incitement, [*Brandenburg v. Ohio,* 395 U.S. 444, 447-449, 89 S.Ct.
1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969) *(per
curiam)*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)*,*
and fighting words, [*Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,* 315 U.S. 568, 572,
62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031
(1942)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=124249671461500618&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)—represent
"well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and
punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional
problem," *id.,* at 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766.

Last Term, in *Stevens,* we held that new categories of
unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that
concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated. *Stevens*
concerned a federal statute purporting to criminalize the creation,
sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty &hellip; The statute covered depictions "in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or
killed" if that harm to the animal was illegal where the "the creation,
sale, or possession t[ook] place," § 48(c)(1). A saving clause largely
borrowed from our obscenity jurisprudence, see [*Miller v. California,*
413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419
(1973),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
exempted depictions with "serious religious, political, scientific,
educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value," § 48(b). We
held that statute to be an impermissible content-based restriction on
speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the *depiction of*
animal cruelty— though States have long had laws against *committing*
it.

The Government argued in *Stevens* that lack of a historical warrant did not matter; that it could create new categories of unprotected speech by applying a "simple balancing test" that weighs the value of a particular category of speech against its social costs and then punishes that category of speech if it fails the test. [*Stevens,* 559 U.S., at \_\_\_, 130 S.Ct., at 1585](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=85657697512539256&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).  We emphatically rejected that "startling and dangerous" proposition. "Maybe there are some categories of speech that have been historically unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed as such in our case law." &hellip; But without persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not revise the "judgment [of] the American people," embodied in the First Amendment, "that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs." 

That holding controls this case. As in *Stevens,* California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of "sexual conduct," [*Miller, supra,* at 24](/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0), [93 S.Ct.  2607](/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).  See also [*Cohen v. California,* 403 U.S. 15, 20, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971)](/scholar_case?case=7398433541275578772&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0); [*Roth, supra,* at 487](/scholar_case?case=14778925784015245625&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0), and n. 20, [77 S.Ct.  1304](/scholar_case?case=14778925784015245625&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).  

*Stevens* was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State's
attempt to shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity.  In *Winters,* we
considered a New York criminal statute "forbid[ding] the massing of stories of
bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime against the person,"
[333 U.S., at 514, 68 S.Ct.
665](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16314089118204976902&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
The New York Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against obscenity.
"[T]here can be no more precise test of written indecency or obscenity," it
said, "than the continuing and changeable experience of the community as to
what types of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public morals
or other analogous injury to the public order." &hellip; That is of course the
same expansive view of governmental power to abridge the freedom of speech
based on interest-balancing that we rejected in *Stevens.* Our opinion in
*Winters,* which concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened
vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech entitled to First
Amendment protection, [333 U.S., at 517-519, 68 S.Ct.
665,](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16314089118204976902&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity that the Constitution
permits to be regulated. The speech reached by the statute contained "no
indecency or obscenity in any sense heretofore known to the law." 

Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no consequence
that California's statute mimics the New York statute regulating
obscenity-for-minors that we upheld in [*Ginsberg v. New York,* 390 U.S.
629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195
(1968)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of *sexual*
material that would be obscene from the perspective of a
child. We held that the legislature could "adjus[t] the
definition of obscenity 'to social realities by permitting the appeal
of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests' of  minors." [88 S.Ct.
1274](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
(quoting [*Mishkin v. New York,* 383 U.S. 502, 509, 86 S.Ct. 958, 16
L.Ed.2d 56
(1966)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4466224718599454757&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)).
And because "obscenity is not protected expression," the New York
statute could be sustained so long as the legislature's judgment that
the proscribed materials were harmful to children "was not irrational."
[390 U.S., at 641, 88 S.Ct.
1274](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).

The California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the
boundaries of an existing category of unprotected speech to ensure that
a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to
children. California does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit
selling offensively violent works *to adults*--and it is wise not to,
since that is but a hair's breadth from the argument rejected in
*Stevens.* Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new category of
content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at
children.

That is unprecedented and mistaken. "[M]inors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them." [*Erznoznik v.  Jacksonville,* 422 U.S. 205, 212-213, 95 S.Ct.](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7611920100258061680&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)[2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7611920100258061680&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) (citation omitted). No doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect children from harm, [*Ginsberg, supra,* at 640-641, 88 S.Ct.  1274](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0); [*Prince v. Massachusetts,* 321 U.S. 158, 165, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed.  645 (1944),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3012582275354260465&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) but that does not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed. "Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them." [*Erznoznik, supra,* at 213-214, 95 S.Ct.  2268](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7611920100258061680&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).

California's argument would fare better if there were a longstanding
tradition in this country of specially restricting children's access to
depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the *books* we give
children to read—or read to them when they are younger—contain no
shortage of gore. Grimm's Fairy Tales, for example, are grim indeed. As
her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is
made to dance in red hot slippers "till she fell dead on the floor, a
sad example of envy and jealousy." Cinderella's evil stepsisters have their eyes
pecked out by doves. And Hansel and Gretel (children!)
kill their captor by baking her in an oven.

High-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer's Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding out his eye with a heated stake. The Odyssey of Homer, Book IX, p. 125 (S. Butcher & A. Lang transls. 1909) ("Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed brand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed about the heated bar.  And the breath of the flame singed his eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye burnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame"). In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay submerged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. And Golding's Lord of the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered *by other children* while marooned on an island.

This is not to say that minors' consumption of violent entertainment has
never encountered resistance. In the 1800's, dime novels depicting crime
and "penny dreadfuls" (named for their price and content) were blamed in
some quarters for juvenile delinquency. See Brief for Cato Institute as
*Amicus Curiae* 6-7. When motion pictures came along, they became the
villains instead. "The days when the police looked upon dime novels as
the most dangerous of textbooks in the school for crime are drawing to a
close &hellip; They say that the moving picture machine &hellip; tends even
more than did the dime novel to turn the thoughts of the easily
influenced to paths which sometimes lead to prison." Moving Pictures as
Helps to Crime, N.Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1909, quoted in Brief for Cato
Institute, at 8. For a time, our Court did permit broad censorship of
movies because of their capacity to be "used for evil," see [*Mutual
Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n of Ohio,* 236 U.S. 230, 242, 35 S.Ct.
387, 59 L.Ed. 552
(1915),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7270078849202844362&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
but we eventually reversed course, [*Joseph Burstyn, Inc.,* 343 U.S., at
502, 72 S.Ct.
777](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5628256980652867975&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0);
see also [*Erznoznik, supra,* at 212-214, 95 S.Ct.
2268](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7611920100258061680&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
(invalidating a drive-in movies restriction designed to protect
children). Radio dramas were next, and then came comic books. Brief for
Cato Institute, at 10-11. Many in the late 1940's and early 1950's
blamed comic books for fostering a "preoccupation with violence and
horror" among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. See
Note, Regulation of Comic Books, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 489, 490 (1955). But
efforts to convince Congress to restrict comic books failed. Brief for
Comic Book Legal Defense Fund as *Amicus Curiae* 11-15.
And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.

California claims that video games present special problems because they
are "interactive," in that the player participates in the
violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature
is nothing new: Since at least the publication of The Adventures of You:
Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-own-adventure
stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by
following instructions about which page to turn to &hellip; As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent
action, that seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind. As Judge
Posner has observed, all literature is interactive. "[T]he better it is,
the more interactive. Literature when it is successful draws the reader
into the story, makes him identify with the characters, invites him to
judge them and quarrel with them, to experience their joys and
sufferings as the reader's own." [*American Amusement Machine Assn. v.
Kendrick,* 244 F.3d 572, 577 (C.A.7
2001)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13025078069235542866&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
(striking down a similar restriction on violent video games).

Justice ALITO has done considerable independent research to identify &hellip; video games in which "the violence is astounding. Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into little pieces &hellip; Blood gushes, splatters, and pools." Justice ALITO recounts all these disgusting video games in order to disgust us--but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice ALITO's description of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violenc--"ethnic cleansing' [of] &hellip; African Americans, Latinos, or Jews." To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow increase the "aggressiveness" that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader's ire, and the reader's desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice ALITO's argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the *ideas* expressed by speech—whether it be violence, or gore, or racism--and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.

### III

Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny--that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.  [*R.A.V.,* 505 U.S., at 395, 112 S.Ct.  2538](/scholar_case?case=14621372290934958371&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0). The State must specifically identify an "actual problem" in need of solving, [*Playboy,* 529 U.S., at 822-823, 120 S.Ct.  1878,](/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0) and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution, see [*R.A.V., supra,* at 395](/scholar_case?case=14621372290934958371&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0), [112 S.Ct.  2538](/scholar_case?case=14621372290934958371&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).  That is a demanding standard. "It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible." [*Playboy, supra,* at 818](/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0), [120 S.Ct.  1878](/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).

California cannot meet that standard. At the outset, it acknowledges
that it cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and
harm to minors. Rather, relying upon our decision in [*Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,* 512 U.S. 622, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129
L.Ed.2d 497
(1994),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5334675097720961353&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
the State claims that it need not produce such proof because the
legislature can make a predictive judgment that such a link exists,
based on competing psychological studies. But reliance on *Turner
Broadcasting* is misplaced. That decision applied *intermediate
scrutiny* to a content-neutral regulation &hellip; California's burden is much higher, and because it bears
the risk of uncertainty, see [*Playboy, supra,* at 816-817, 120 S.Ct.
1878,](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11989907166283121695&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
ambiguous proof will not suffice.

The State's evidence is not compelling. California relies primarily on
the research of Dr. Craig Anderson and a few other research
psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between
exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These
studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, 
and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games *cause*
minors to *act* aggressively (which would at least be a beginning).
Instead, "[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not
evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant,
admitted flaws in methodology." *Video Software Dealers Assn.* [556
F.3d, at
964](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18016190414381938126&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
They show at best some correlation between exposure to violent
entertainment and minuscule real-world effects, such as children's
feeling more aggressive or making louder noises in the few minutes after
playing a violent game than after playing a nonviolent
game.

Even taking for granted Dr. Anderson's conclusions that violent video
games produce some effect on children's feelings of aggression, those
effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by
other media. In his testimony in a similar lawsuit, Dr. Anderson
admitted that the "effect sizes" of children's exposure to violent video
games are "about the same" as that produced by their exposure to
violence on television. And he admits that the *same* effects
have been found when children watch cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the
Road Runner, or when they play video games like Sonic
the Hedgehog that are rated "E" (appropriate for all ages), or even when they "vie[w] a picture of a gun."

Of course, California has (wisely) declined to restrict
Saturday morning cartoons, the sale of games rated for young children,
or the distribution of pictures of guns. The consequence is that its
regulation is wildly underinclusive when judged against its asserted
justification, which in our view is alone enough to defeat it.
Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is
in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a
particular speaker or viewpoint. See [*City of Ladue v. Gilleo,* 512
U.S. 43, 51, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 129 L.Ed.2d 36
(1994)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3859249994867287155&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0);
[*Florida Star v. B.J.F.,* 491 U.S. 524, 540, 109 S.Ct. 2603, 105
L.Ed.2d 443
(1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11083261902857685106&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for
disfavored treatment--at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists,
and movie producers--and has given no persuasive reason why.

The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect—and a
respect that renders irrelevant the contentions of the concurrence and
the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other
portrayals of violence. The California Legislature is perfectly willing
to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of children
so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it's OK. And there
are not even any requirements as to how this parental or avuncular
relationship is to be verified; apparently the child's or putative
parent's, aunt's, or uncle's say-so suffices. That is not how one
addresses a serious social problem.

California claims that the Act is justified in aid of parental
authority: By requiring that the purchase of violent video games can be
made only by adults, the Act ensures that parents can decide what games
are appropriate. At the outset, we note our doubts that punishing third
parties for conveying protected speech to children *just in case* their
parents disapprove of that speech is a proper governmental means of
aiding parental authority. Accepting that position would largely vitiate
the rule that "only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances
may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to
[minors]." [*Erznoznik,* 422 U.S., at 212-213, 95 S.Ct.
2268](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7611920100258061680&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).

But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act's
restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict
their children's access to violent video games but cannot do so. The
video-game industry has in place a voluntary rating system designed to
inform consumers about the content of games. The system, implemented by
the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), assigns age-specific
ratings to each video game submitted: EC (Early Childhood); E
(Everyone); E10 + (Everyone 10 and older); T (Teens); M (17 and older);
and AO (Adults Only—18 and older). App. 86. The Video Software Dealers
Association encourages retailers to prominently display information
about the ESRB system in their stores; to refrain from renting or
selling adults-only games to minors; and to rent or sell "M" rated games
to minors only with parental consent. In 2009,
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that, as a result of this
system, "the video game industry outpaces the movie and music
industries" in "(1) restricting target-marketing of mature-rated
products to children; (2) clearly and prominently disclosing rating
information; and (3) restricting children's access to mature-rated
products at retail." &hellip; This
system does much to ensure that minors cannot purchase seriously violent
games on their own, and that parents who care about the matter can
readily evaluate the games their children bring home. Filling the
remaining modest gap in concerned-parents' control can hardly be a
compelling state interest.

And finally, the Act's purported aid to parental authority is vastly
overinclusive. Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase
violent video games on their own have parents who *care* whether they
purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation's effect may
indeed be in support of what some parents of the restricted children
actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State
thinks parents *ought* to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to
"assisting parents" that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.

### \* \* \*

California's effort to regulate violent video games is the latest
episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor violent
entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of
the evidence brought forward to support the harmfulness of video games
is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns that
underlie the attempt to regulate them—concerns that may and doubtless do
prompt a good deal of parental oversight. We have no business passing
judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video
games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young
or harm their moral development. Our task is only to say whether or not
such works constitute a "well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of
speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought
to raise any Constitutional problem," [*Chaplinsky,* 315 U.S., at
571-572, 62 S.Ct.
766](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=124249671461500618&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0)
(the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such
works is justified by that high degree of necessity we have described as
a compelling state interest (it is not). Even where the protection of
children is the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action
apply.

California's legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a
serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their
children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment
rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously
underinclusive 2742\*2742 nor seriously overinclusive. See [*Church of
Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,* 508 U.S. 520, 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217,
124 L.Ed.2d 472
(1993)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=975414503455261754&q=brown+entertainment+merchants&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&scilh=0).
As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the
legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes
portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a
parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned
parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First
Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles)
think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the overbreadth in
achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the
other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot
survive strict scrutiny.

We affirm the judgment below.

*It is so ordered.*

### I

On December 1, 1997, Michael Carneal brought a .22-caliber pistol and
five shotguns into the lobby of Heath High School in Paducah, Kentucky.
At the time, Carneal was a 14-year-old freshman student at the school.
Upon his arrival, Carneal began shooting into a crowd of students,
wounding five. His shots killed an additional three: Jessica James,
Kayce Steger, and Nicole Hadley. Carneal was arrested and convicted of
murdering James, Steger, and Hadley.

Subsequent investigations revealed that Carneal regularly played "Doom,"
"Quake," "Castle Wolfenstein," "Redneck Rampage," "Nightmare Creatures,"
"Mech Warrior," "Resident Evil," and "Final Fantasy," which are
interactive computer games that, in various ways, all involve the
 player shooting virtual opponents. Carneal also possessed a
video tape containing the movie, "The Basketball Diaries," in a few
minutes of which the high-school-student protagonist dreams of killing
his teacher and several of his fellow classmates. Investigators examined
Carneal's computer and discovered that he had visited
"www.persiankitty.com," which appears to catalogue and link to sites
with sexually-suggestive material. It also appeared that through
"www.adultkey.com," *www.adultkey.com,* a site operated by Network
Authentication Systems and designed to restrict access to certain
websites to viewers over certain ages, Carneal was granted age
verification sufficient to visit many other pornographic sites.

The parents, who also are the estate administrators, of James, Steger,
and Hadley filed this action in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Kentucky. James's complaint named as defendants the
companies that produce or maintain the above-mentioned movie, video
games, and internet sites. James stated essentially three causes of
action against the defendants. First, James alleged that the defendants
had been negligent in that they either knew or should have known that
the distribution of their material to Carneal and other young people
created an unreasonable risk of harm to others. James alleged that
exposure to the defendants' material made young people insensitive to
violence and more likely to commit violent acts. But for Carneal's
steady diet of the defendants' material, James contended, Carneal would
not have committed his violent acts.

Second, James asserted that the video game cartridges, movie cassettes,
and internet transmissions that the defendants produced and distributed
were "products" for purposes of Kentucky product liability law.
According to James, the violent features of the movie, games, and
internet sites were product defects. The defendants, as producers and
distributors of the "products," are strictly liable under Kentucky law
for damages caused by such product defects.

The third claim that James raised was that some of the defendants'
conduct had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 *et seq.* According to James, the defendant firms
that maintained internet sites engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity by distributing obscene material to minors.

The defendants moved to dismiss all of James's actions for failing to
state any claim on which relief could be granted. *See* Fed.R.Civ.P.
12(b)(6). The district court granted the defendants' motion. The
district court held that Carneal's actions were not sufficiently
foreseeable to impose a duty of reasonable care on the defendants with
regard to Carneal's victims. Alternatively, the district court held that
even if such a duty existed, Carneal's actions constituted a superseding
cause of the victims' injuries, defeating the element of proximate
causation notwithstanding the defendants' negligence. With regard to
James's second cause of action, the district court determined that the
"thoughts, ideas and images" purveyed by the defendants' movie, video
games, and internet sites were not "products" for purposes of Kentucky
law and therefore the defendants could not be held strictly liable for
any alleged defects. Finally, the district court held that James had not
stated a viable RICO claim against the defendant internet firms. Among
other reasons, the district court explained that James had alleged RICO
predicate acts, but had failed to identify an organization that had been
corrupted, and had failed to show any injury  to "business or
property" as required for standing under RICO.

James now appeals the district court dismissal of his negligence and
product liability claims. We can discern no argument in James's brief
assigning error to the district court's dismissal of his RICO claim, and
therefore consider such an argument waived. Accordingly, this appeal
raises questions of only Kentucky law.

[Section II setting forth the standard of review omitted.]

### III

James contends that the defendants in this case acted negligently,
perhaps in producing, but at least in distributing to young people,
their materials. It was this negligence, according to James, that caused
Carneal to undertake his violent actions and that thereby caused the
deaths of the plaintiffs' daughters. In order to establish an actionable
tort under Kentucky law, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant
owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, that the defendant breached that
duty of care, and that the *defendant's breach* was the proximate cause
of the plaintiff's damages.

#### A. The Existence of a Duty of Care

The "existence of a duty of care" as an element of a tort cause of
action is of relatively recent vintage. At early English common law, the
existence of a duty of care was not considered as an element of an
actionable tort. Then, tort law attached strict liability for any
damages that resulted from "wrongful acts." Prosser on Torts § 53. The
requirement that the plaintiff establish that he was owed a specific
duty of care by the defendant came with the advent of negligence in
place of  strict liability. *See generally* Percy H. Winfield,
*Duty in Tortious Negligence,* 34 Colum. L.Rev. 41 (1934). As a separate
basis of liability, negligence was simply too broad, according to later
English courts. Accordingly, the concept of limited duty disciplined the
concept of negligence, requiring the plaintiff to establish a definite
legal obligation.&hellip; 

Thus, Kentucky courts have held that the determination of whether a duty
of care exists is whether the harm to the plaintiff resulting from the
defendant's negligence was "foreseeable." Foreseeability is an often
invoked, but not terribly well defined, concept in the common law of
tort &hellip; Kentucky's
particular use of foreseeability in the duty inquiry finds its roots in
perhaps the most famous application of the foreseeability principle. In
[*Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.,* 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99
(1928),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=8468647111215907111&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
then-Judge Cardozo determined that the defendant's duty is to avoid
"risks reasonably to be perceived." *Id.* at 100. As every former law
student remembers, the plaintiff in *Palsgraf* had bought a train ticket
to travel to the Rockaways for the afternoon and was waiting on the
station platform. Two men were rushing to catch a departing train, one
easily hopped on board and the other struggled to pull himself onto the
rear car. A conductor on the train pulled him on board, but in the
process, the struggling passenger dropped onto the rails the brown-paper
package he was carrying. The package was full of fireworks and exploded.
The explosion overturned a  large set of scales on the platform,
which struck Palsgraf, and Palsgraf sued the railroad for her injuries.

Cardozo determined that the railroad simply did not owe a duty to
Palsgraf to protect against *the injury that she suffered.* For Cardozo,
the harm that Palsgraf suffered was not sufficiently probable that the
railroad employees could have been expected to anticipate it occurring
from their actions. Cardozo's reasoning, although implying that Palsgraf
was the unforeseeable plaintiff, rested on the improbability of the
*harm* that she suffered arising from the defendant's particular
actions. *Id.* at 101. For Cardozo too, the existence of a duty of care
was a creature of circumstance.

Cardozo's opinion in *Palsgraf,* while cited as the cornerstone of the
American doctrine of a limited duty of care, has been criticized for its
conclusory reasoning regarding whether Palsgraf's harm really was
sufficiently unforeseeable &hellip; Such conclusory reasoning
has been endemic in the jurisprudence of determining duty by assessing
foreseeability. Courts often end up merely listing factual reasons why a
particular harm, although having materialized, would have appeared
particularly unlikely in advance and then simply asserting that the harm
was too unlikely to be foreseeable and to create a duty to exercise due
care in protecting against it. What has not emerged is any clear
standard regarding what makes a projected harm too improbable to be
foreseeable.&hellip;

Thus, we are called, as best we can, to implement Kentucky's duty of
care analysis in this case. Our inquiry is whether the deaths of James,
Steger, and Hadley were the reasonably foreseeable result of the
defendants' creation and distribution of their games, movie, and
internet sites. Whether an event was reasonably foreseeable is not for
us to determine with the assistance of hindsight &hellip; The mere fact that the risk may have materialized does little to resolve the foreseeability question.

[Kentucky courts wrestling with foreseeability questions ask about the "likelihood of the injuries
produced." For instance, in dram shop cases, injured plaintiffs have also sought to hold defendant dram shops liable for the actions of their overserved customers. In 1987, The Kentucky Supreme Court has held that an automobile accident injuring third parties
was a [reasonably foreseeable result of the negligent act of serving
alcohol to an intoxicated individual](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16532176860606685190&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0). But twelve years later the court held that [an intoxicated patron fighting
with and shooting a fellow customer was simply not a foreseeable result
of continuing to serve the patron alcohol.](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8378611870130381594&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)]

Intentional violence is less likely to result from intoxication than
negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Yet, the Kentucky Supreme Court
never makes clear how unlikely is too unlikely for a particular type of
harm to be unforeseeable. The cases do not create a principle, portable
to the context of this case, for evaluating the probability of harm.

This court has encountered this foreseeability inquiry under Kentucky
law before in a situation similar to this case. In [*Watters v. TSR,
Inc.,* 904 F.2d 378 (6th
Cir.1990),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10196421278862987651&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the mother of a suicide victim sued TSR for manufacturing the game
"Dungeons and Dragons." The suicide victim regularly played the game.
The mother contended that the game's violent  content
"desensitized" the victim to violence and caused him to undertake the
violent act of shooting himself in the head. We held that the boy's
suicide was simply not a reasonably foreseeable result of producing the
game, notwithstanding its violent content. To have held otherwise would
have been "to stretch the concepts of foreseeability and ordinary care
to lengths that would deprive them of all normal meaning." *Id.* at 381.

Foreseeability, however, is a slippery concept. Indeed, it could be
argued that we ourselves confused it with some concept of negligence. We
noted in *Watters:* "The defendant cannot be faulted, obviously, for
putting its game on the market without attempting to ascertain the
mental condition of each and every prospective player." *Ibid.* We
almost appeared to say that the costs of acquiring such knowledge would
so outweigh the social benefits that it would not be negligent to
abstain from such an investigation. We can put the *foreseeability*
point a little more precisely, however. It appears simply impossible to
predict that these games, movie, and internet sites (alone, or in what
combinations) would incite a young person to violence. Carneal's
reaction to the games and movies at issue here, assuming that his
violent actions were such a reaction, was simply too idiosyncratic to
expect the defendants to have anticipated it. We find that it is simply
too far a leap from shooting characters on a video screen (an activity
undertaken by millions) to shooting people in a classroom (an activity
undertaken by a handful, at most) for Carneal's actions to have been
reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturers of the media that Carneal
played and viewed.

At first glance, our conclusion also appears to be little more than an
assertion. Mental health experts could quite plausibly opine about the
manner in which violent movies and video games affect viewer behavior.
We need not stretch to imagine some mixture of impressionability and
emotional instability that might unnaturally react with the violent
content of the "Basketball Diaries" or "Doom." Of course, Carneal's
reaction was not a normal reaction. Indeed, Carneal is not a normal
person, but it is not utter craziness to predict that someone like
Carneal is out there.

We return, however, to the Kentucky court's observation that the
existence of a duty of care reflects a judicial policy judgment at
bottom. From the Kentucky cases on foreseeability, we can discern two
relevant policies that counsel against finding that Carneal's violent
actions were the reasonably foreseeable result of defendants'
distribution of games, movies, and internet material.

#### 1. The Duty to Protect Against Intentional Criminal Actions

First, courts have held that, except under extraordinary circumstances,
individuals are generally entitled to assume that third parties will not
commit intentional criminal acts.&hellip; The reasons behind this general rule are simple enough. The first reason is a probabilistic judgment that foreseeability analysis requires.
Individuals generally are significantly deterred from undertaking
intentional criminal conduct given the sanctions that can follow. The
threatened sanctions make the third-party intentional criminal conduct
sufficiently less likely that, under normal circumstances, we do not
require the putative tort defendant to anticipate it. Indeed, this
statistical observation explains the distinction drawn by Kentucky
courts in the dram shop liability cases.

The second reason is structural. The system of criminal liability has
concentrated responsibility for an intentional criminal act in the
primary actor, his accomplices, and his co-conspirators. By imposing
liability on those who did not endeavor to accomplish the intentional
criminal undertaking, tort liability would diminish the responsibility
placed on the criminal defendant. The normative message of tort law in
these situations would be that the defendant is not entirely responsible
for his intentional criminal act.

Does this case involve the extraordinary circumstances under which we
would require the defendants to anticipate a third party's intentional
criminal act? Kentucky courts have found such circumstances when the
tort defendant had previously developed "a special relationship" with
the victim of a third-party intentional criminal act.&hellip; 

This duty to protect can be triggered by placing the
putative plaintiff in custody or by taking other affirmative steps that
disable the plaintiff from protecting himself against third-party
intentional criminal acts. Of course, a special relationship can be
created by a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. 

We can find nothing close to a "special relationship" in this case. The
defendants did not even know James, Steger, and Hadley prior to
Carneal's actions, much less take any affirmative steps that disabled
them from protecting themselves.

Courts have held, under extremely limited circumstances, that
individuals, notwithstanding their relationship with the victims of
third-party violence, can be liable when their affirmative actions
"create a high degree of risk of [the third party's] intentional
misconduct." Restatement of Torts (Second) § 302B, cmt. e.H. Generally,
such circumstances are limited to cases in which the defendant has given
a young child access to ultra-hazardous materials such as blasting caps,
[*Vills v. City of Cloquet,* 119 Minn. 277, 138 N.W. 33
(1912),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=15516340448157145729&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
or firearms. [*Spivey v. Sheeler,* 514 S.W.2d 667
(Ky.1974)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12187369012283356840&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Even in those cases, courts have relied on the third party's severely
diminished capacity to handle the ultra-hazardous materials. With older
third  parties, courts have found liability only where
defendants have vested a particular person, under circumstances that
made his nefarious plans clear, with the tools that he then quickly used
to commit the criminal act. *See* [*Meers v. McDowell,* 110 Ky. 926, 62
S.W. 1013
(1901)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=13723756947186741433&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Arguably, the defendants' games, movie, and internet sites gave Carneal
the ideas and emotions, the "psychological tools," to commit three
murders. However, this case lacks such crucial features of our
jurisprudence in this area. First, the defendants in this case had no
idea Carneal even existed, much less the particular idiosyncracies of
Carneal that made their products particularly dangerous in his hands. In
every case that this court has discovered in which defendants have been
held liable for negligently creating an unreasonably high risk of
third-party criminal conduct, the defendants have been specifically
aware of the peculiar tendency of a particular person to commit a
criminal act with the defendants' materials.

Second, no court has ever held that ideas and images can constitute the
tools for a criminal act under this narrow exception. Beyond their
intangibility, such ideas and images are at least one step removed from
the implements that can be used in the criminal act itself. In the cases
supporting this exception, the item that the defendant has given to the
third-party criminal actor has been the direct instrument of harm.

#### 2. First Amendment Problems

Moreover, we are loath to hold that ideas and images can constitute the
tools for a criminal act under this exception, or even to attach tort
liability to the dissemination of ideas. We agree with the district
court that attaching tort liability to the effect that such ideas have
on a criminal actor would raise significant constitutional problems
under the First Amendment that ought to be avoided.&hellip;  

Although the plaintiffs' contentions in this case do not
concern the absolute proscription of the defendants' conduct, courts
have made clear that attaching tort liability to protected speech can
violate the First Amendment. *See* [*New York Times v. Sullivan,* 376
U.S. 254, 265, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686
(1964)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("Although this is a civil lawsuit between private parties, the Alabama
courts have applied a state rule of law which petitioners claim to
impose invalid restrictions on their constitutional freedoms of speech
and press. It matters not that that law has been applied in a civil
action and that it is common law only, though supplemented by
statute.").

[The court found that movies and video games are protected speech under the First Amendment.

> Expression, to be constitutionally protected, need not constitute the
reasoned discussion of the public affairs, but may also be for purposes
of entertainment.]

To say that the features of the defendants' products of which the
plaintiffs complain are protected by the First Amendment is not
necessarily to say that attaching tort liability to those features
raises significant constitutional problems. The plaintiffs' argument is
more nuanced: they do not seek to hold the defendants responsible merely
for distributing their materials to anyone, but to young, impressionable
children or, even more specifically, to Carneal. The protections of the
First Amendment have always adapted to the audience intended for the
speech. Specifically, we have recognized certain speech, while fully
protected when directed to adults, may be restricted when directed
towards minors. *See, e.g.,* [*Sable Communications v. FCC,* 492 U.S.
115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93

We have also required, however, that such regulations be narrowly
tailored to protecting minors from speech that may improperly influence
them and not effect an "unnecessarily broad suppression of speech"
appropriate for adults. [*Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union,* 521

Of course, the measure here intended to protect minors from the improper
influence of otherwise protected speech is quite different from the
regulations that we have countenanced in the past. Those regulations
were the product of the reasoned deliberation of democratically elected
legislative bodies, or at least regulatory agencies exercising authority
delegated by such  bodies. It was legislative bodies that had
demarcated what otherwise protected speech was inappropriate for
children and that had outlined in advance the measures that speakers
were required to take in order to protect children from the speech.

In contrast, the question before us is whether to permit tort liability
for protected speech that was not sufficiently prevented from reaching
minors. At trial, the plaintiff would undoubtedly argue about the
efficient measures that the defendants should have taken to protect the
children. But at the end of this process, it would be impossible for
reviewing courts to evaluate whether the proposed protective measures
would be narrowly tailored regulations. Who would know what omission the
jury relied upon to find the defendants negligent? Moreover, under the
concept of negligence, there is no room for evaluating the value of the
speech itself. The question before a jury evaluating James's claim of
negligence would ask whether the defendants took efficient precautions,
in keeping their material from Carneal, that would be less expensive
than the amount of the loss, the three deaths.

We cannot adequately exercise our responsibilities to evaluate
regulations of protected speech, even those designed for the protection
of children, that are imposed pursuant to a trial for tort liability.
Crucial to the safeguard of strict scrutiny is that we have a clear
limitation, articulated in the legislative statute or an administrative
regulation, to evaluate. "Whither our children,"as Appellant's brief
states at 3, is an important question, but their guidance through the
regulation of protected speech should be directed in the first instance
to the legislative and executive branches of state and federal
governments, not the courts.

Our concerns about adequately evaluating the narrow tailoring of
regulations wane if the underlying expression is completely unprotected.
Whether certain speech is not protected at all is a question that courts
are regularly called upon to answer. James argues that to the extent
that the content distributed by the defendants is at all expressive, it
constitutes obscene material that is unprotected by the First Amendment.
*See* [*Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,* 413 U.S. 49, 69, 93 S.Ct.
2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446
(1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7437343063858529835&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
It would be novel to argue that the video games and *The Basketball
Diaries* are obscene. As we understand James's complaint, he complains
that the video games and the movie are excessively violent — yet we have
generally applied our obscenity jurisprudence only to material of a
sexual nature, appealing only to prurient interest and lacking any other
socially redeeming value. *See* [*Miller v. California,* 413 U.S. 15,
23-24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419
(1973)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=287180442152313659&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("We now confine the scope of [obscene material] to works which depict
or describe sexual conduct."); [*United States v. Thoma,* 726 F.2d 1191,
1200 (7th
Cir.1984)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6449473028065384946&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(holding that because depictions of violence are not sexual, obscenity
jurisprudence does not apply).

With the sexually-oriented internet defendants, James has an arguable
basis to allege that the material is unprotected speech under our
conventional obscenity jurisprudence. Nevertheless, where the First
Amendment concerns wane the most with the possibility of obscenity, the
foreseeability problems loom the largest. In his complaint, James
contends that the sexual content displayed by the internet sites made
"virtual sex pleasurable and attractive" for Carneal and caused him to
undertake his violent actions. To us, however, James's allegations
regarding his exposure to violence seem much closer to the mark. After
all, James does not seek to hold the internet defendants responsible
 for a sexual crime: Carneal never endeavored sexually to abuse
his victims, just to kill them.

With the movie and video game defendants, James contends that their
material is excessively violent and constitutes obscene, non-protected
speech. We decline to extend our obscenity jurisprudence to violent,
instead of sexually explicit, material. Even if we were to consider such
an expansion, James's arguments are not conceptually linked to our
obscenity jurisprudence. The concept of obscenity was designed to permit
the regulation of "offensive" material, that is, material that people
find "disgusting" or "degrading." *See* [*American Amusement Mach. Ass'n
v. Kendrick,* 244 F.3d 572, 574 (7th
Cir.2001)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13025078069235542866&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
James's argument, on the other hand, is that the violent content of
these video games and the movie shapes behavior and causes its consumers
to commit violent acts. This is a different claim than the obscenity
doctrine, which is a limit on the extent to which the community's
sensibilities can be shocked by speech, not a protection against the
behavior that the speech creates. *Id.* at 574-75 (holding that the law
of obscenity does not apply to the argument that violence in video games
causes players to commit violent acts).

This is not to say that protecting people from the violence that speech
might incite is a completely impermissible purpose for regulating
speech. However, we have generally handled that endeavor under a
different category of our First Amendment jurisprudence, excluding from
constitutional protection those communicated ideas and images that
incite others to violence. Speech that falls within this category of
incitement is not entitled to First Amendment protection. *See* [*R.A.V.
v. City of St. Paul,* 505 U.S. 377, 384-85, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d
305
(1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14621372290934958371&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The Court firmly set out the test for whether speech constitutes
unprotected incitement to violence in [*Brandenburg v. Ohio,* 395 U.S.
444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430
(1969)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
In protecting against the propensity of expression to cause violence,
states may only regulate that speech which is "*directed to* inciting or
producing *imminent* lawless action and *is likely to incite* or produce
such action." *Id.* at 447 (emphasis added).

The violent material in the video games and *The Basketball Diaries*
falls well short of this threshold. First, while the defendants in this
case may not have exercised exquisite care regarding the persuasive
power of the violent material that they disseminated, they certainly did
not "intend" to produce violent actions by the consumers, as is required
by the *Brandenburg* test. [*Hess v. Indiana,* 414 U.S. 105, 108, 94
S.Ct. 326, 38 L.Ed.2d
303](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4042159652386241321&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(requiring evidence that the speaker "intended" his words to produce
violent conduct under the *Brandenburg* test). Second, the threat of a
person like Carneal reacting to the violent content of the defendants'
media was not "imminent." Even the theory of causation in this case is
that persistent exposure to the defendants' media gradually undermined
Carneal's moral discomfort with violence to the point that he solved his
social disputes with a gun. This glacial process of personality
development is far from the temporal imminence that we have required to
satisfy the *Brandenburg* test. [*Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4016009721484982910&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
("The mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a
sufficient reason for banning it absent some showing of a direct
connection between the speech and imminent illegal conduct."); [*McCoy
v. Stewart,* 282 F.3d 626, 631 (9th
Cir.2002)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4786465207502783304&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(holding that incitement is not imminent if it risks third-party
violence at some "indefinite future time").  Third, it is a long
leap from the proposition that Carneal's actions were foreseeable to the
*Brandenburg* requirement that the violent content was "likely" to cause
Carneal to behave this way.

James contends that the *Brandenburg* test for speech inciting violence
does not apply to depictions of violence, but instead only to political
discourse advocating imminent violence. James suggests that the
suppression of expression that is not advocacy, but does tend to inspire
violence in its viewers or consumers, is governed by a less stringent
standard. Federal courts, however, have generally demanded that all
expression, advocacy or not, meet the *Brandenburg* test before its
regulation for its tendency to incite violence is permitted. *See*
[*Dworkin v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,* 867 F.2d 1188, 1199-1200 (9th
Cir.1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=391927733878660348&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(applying the *Brandenburg* test to arguments that pornography causes
viewers to engage in conduct that is violent and degrading to women);
[*Herceg v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.,* 814 F.2d 1017, 1024 (5th
Cir.1987)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7844372980201599517&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(rejecting suggestion "that a less stringent standard than the
*Brandenburg* test be applied in cases involving non-political speech
that has actually produced harm.").

Like the district court, we withhold resolution of these constitutional
questions given the adequacy of the state law grounds for upholding the
dismissal. Attaching such tort liability to the ideas and images
conveyed by the video games, the movie, and the internet sites, however,
raises grave constitutional concerns that provide yet an additional
policy reason not to impose a duty of care between the defendants and
the victims in this case.

[The court's discussion of proximate causation omitted.] 

### IV

James also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his
products liability claims. In his complaint, James alleged that the
defendants' video games, movie, and internet transmissions constitute
"products," and their violent content "product defects." Under Kentucky
law, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of "products" are
strictly liable for damages caused by "defects" in those products.
[*Clark v. Hauck Mfg. Co.,* 910 S.W.2d 247, 250
(Ky.1995)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=218030355871374852&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0);
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A. If this theory of liability were
to apply, James's failure to establish a duty to exercise ordinary care
to prevent the victims' injuries (See Part III.A) would be irrelevant.
Under strict liability, James would only be required to establish
causation.

James's theory of product liability in this case is deeply flawed.
First, and something none of the parties have mentioned, the "consumers
or ultimate users" of the alleged products are not the ones claiming
physical harm in this case. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A.
Carneal was the person who "consumed" or "used" the video games, movie,
and internet sites. Allegedly because of Carneal's consumption of the
products, he killed the victims in this case. In early products
liability law, courts had required privity between the final retailer of
the product and the injured plaintiff for strict liability to attach.
Eventually, courts broadened the class of plaintiffs who could avail
themselves of strict liability to include those who consumed or
ultimately used the product. Kentucky courts, but certainly not all
courts, have extended the protection of products liability to
"bystanders" who are injured by the product, but are not "using" or
"consuming" the product. [*Embs v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of
Lexington,* 528 S.W.2d 703
(Ky.1975)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14151903145400687453&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(holding that bystander could recover on strict liability basis for
injuries caused by exploding soda bottle); Restatement (Second) of Torts
§ 402A, n.1 (noting the split in authority regarding whether bystanders
may recover on a strict liability basis). Imposing strict liability for
the injuries suffered in this case would be an extension of Kentucky's
bystander jurisprudence, as the decedents were not directly injured by
the products themselves, but by Carneal's reaction to the products.

We place this open question of Kentucky law aside as the parties
apparently have. James has failed to demonstrate a prior requirement,
that the video  games, movies, and internet sites are "products"
for purposes of strict liability. This was the basis on which the
district court dismissed James's products liability claims, holding that
the video games, movie, and internet transmissions were not "products,"
at least in the sense that James sought to attach liability to them.

This court has already substantially resolved the question of Kentucky
law presented. In [*Watters v. TSR,* 904 F.2d 378 (6th
Cir.1990),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10196421278862987651&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
this court held that "words and pictures" contained in a board game
could not constitute "products" for purposes of maintaining a strict
liability action. We cannot find any intervening Kentucky authority that
persuades us that *Watters* no longer correctly states Kentucky law.
James's theory of liability, that the ideas conveyed by the video games,
movie cassettes and internet transmissions, caused Carneal to kill his
victims, attempts to attach product liability in a nearly identical way.

James argues that, at least in this case, we are not just dealing with
"words and pictures." Carneal, of course, had video game cartridges and
movie cassettes. James argues that the test for determining whether an
item is a product for purposes of Kentucky law is whether it is
"tangible," and that the cartridges and cassettes are "tangible." As for
the internet sites, James points us to a court that has held that
"electricity" is a "product" for purposes of strict liability under
Kentucky law. *See* [*C.G. Bryant v. Tri-County Elec. Membership Corp.,*
844 F.Supp. 347, 352
(W.D.Ky.1994)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14353781368890549739&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Internet sites are nothing more than communicative electrical pulses,
James contends. James argues that there is no relevant difference
between the internet transmissions and the electricity.

And of course James is partially correct. Certainly if a video cassette
exploded and injured its user, we would hold it a "product" and its
producer strictly liable for the user's physical damages. In this case,
however, James is arguing that the words and images purveyed on the
tangible cassettes, cartridges, and perhaps even the electrical pulses
through the internet, caused Carneal to snap and to effect the deaths of
the victims. When dealing with ideas and images, courts have been
willing to separate the sense in which the tangible containers of those
ideas are products from their communicative element for purposes of
strict liability.&hellip; 

[*See, e.g.,* [*Winter v. G.P. Putnam's Sons,* 938 F.2d 1033, 1036 (9th
Cir.1991)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8197049031942033273&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)(publisher owed no duty of care to mushroom enthusiasts who relied on misinformation contained in *The Encyclopedia of Mushrooms*); [*Jones v. J.B. Lippincott Co.,* 694 F.Supp. 1216, 1217-18 (D.Md.  1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12134749983314046468&q=james+meow&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)(publisher of medical text not liable for injuries suffered by nursing student who treated herself for constipation after consulting the text and suffered injury).]

We find these decisions well reasoned. The video game cartridges, movie
cassette, and internet transmissions are not sufficiently "tangible" to
constitute products in the sense of their communicative content.

### V

For all the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal
of all James's claims.

## Herceg v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.

###### Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (1987)

* [case at Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7844372980201599517)
* [case at Westlaw](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=814f2d1017&appflag=67.12)
* [Erotic asphyxiation at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_asphyxiation).  

An adolescent read a magazine article that prompted him to commit an act
that proved fatal. The issue is whether the publisher of the magazine
may be held liable for civil damages.

In its August 1981 issue, as part of a series about the pleasures — and
dangers — of unusual and taboo sexual practices, *Hustler Magazine*
printed "Orgasm of Death," an article discussing the practice of
autoerotic asphyxia. This practice entails masturbation while "hanging"
oneself in order to temporarily cut off the blood supply to the brain at
the moment of orgasm. The article included details about how the act is
performed and the kind of physical pleasure those who engage in it seek
to achieve. The heading identified "Orgasm of Death" as part of a series
on "Sexplay," discussions of "sexual pleasures [that] have remained
hidden for too long behind the doors of fear, ignorance, inexperience
and hypocrisy" and are presented "to increase [readers'] sexual
knowledge, to lessen [their] inhibitions and — ultimately — to make
[them] much better lover[s]."

An editor's note, positioned on the page so that it is likely to be the
first text the reader will read, states: "Hustler emphasizes the
often-fatal dangers of the practice of 'auto-erotic asphyxia,' and
recommends that readers seeking unique forms of sexual release DO NOT
ATTEMPT this method. The facts are presented here solely for an
educational purpose."

The article begins by presenting a vivid description of the tragic
results the practice may create. It describes the death of one victim
and discusses research indicating that such deaths are alarmingly
common: as many as 1,000 United States teenagers die in this manner each
year. Although it describes the sexual "high" and "thrill" those who
engage in the practice seek to achieve, the article repeatedly warns
that the procedure is "neither healthy nor harmless," "it is a serious —
and often-fatal — mistake to believe that asphyxia can be controlled,"
and "beyond a  doubt — auto-asphyxiation is one form of
sex play you try only if you're anxious to wind up in cold storage, with
a coroner's tag on your big toe." The two-page article warns readers at
least ten different times that the practice is dangerous,
self-destructive and deadly. It states that persons who successfully
perform the technique can achieve intense physical pleasure, but the
attendant risk is that the person may lose consciousness and die of
strangulation.

Tragically, a copy of this issue of Hustler came into the possession of
Troy D., a fourteen-year-old adolescent, who read the article and
attempted the practice. The next morning, Troy's nude body was found,
hanging by its neck in his closet, by one of Troy's closest friends,
Andy V. A copy of *Hustler Magazine,* opened to the article about the
"Orgasm of Death," was found near his feet.

[Troy's mother, Diane Herceg, and Troy's friend (Andy V.) sued Hustler to recover damages for emotional and psychological harms they suffered as a result of Troy's death and for exemplary damages, alleging negligence, products liability, dangerous instrumentality, and attractive nuisance, and incitement. In response, Hustler filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district dismissed all claims, save the incitment claim and the case was allowed to go to the jury on incitement alone.  

The jury returned a verdict in
favor of the plaintiffs awarding Diane Herceg \$69,000 in actual damages
and \$100,000 exemplary damages and awarding Andy V. \$3,000 for the
pain and mental suffering he endured as the bystander who discovered
Troy's body and \$10,000 exemplary damages. ]

### Incitement

Although we are doubtful that a magazine article that is no more direct
than "Orgasm of Death" can ever constitute an incitement in the sense in
which the Supreme Court — in cases we discuss below — has employed that
term to identify unprotected speech the states may punish without
violating the first amendment, we first analyze the evidence on the
theory that it might satisfy doctrinal tests relating to incitement, for
that was the theory under which the case was tried and submitted.
Substituting our judgment for the jury's, as we must, we hold that
liability cannot be imposed on Hustler on the basis that the article was
an incitement to attempt a potentially fatal act without impermissibly
infringing upon freedom of speech.

The word incitement, like many of the words in our complex language, can
carry  different meanings. It is properly used to refer to
encouragement of conduct that might harm the public such as the
violation of law or the use of force. But when the word is used in that
context, the state may not punish such an inducement unless the speech
involved is, as the Supreme Court held in [*Brandenburg v.
Ohio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0), "directed to inciting or producing *imminent* lawless action and &hellip; *likely* to incite or produce such action."

Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan leader garbed in Klan regalia, had delivered
a speech threatening that, "if our President, our Congress, our Supreme
Court, continues to supress the white, caucasion race, it is posible
that there might have to be some revengence (sic) taken." He challenged
his conviction under an Ohio statute that punished "advocacy of the
duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful
methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political
reform." The Supreme Court reversed his conviction
because neither the statute nor the state court's jury instruction
distinguished between advocacy and incitement to imminent lawless
action, and only the latter might constitutionally be forbidden.

Hustler argues that *Brandenburg* provides the controlling principle,
and the plaintiffs assume that it may. If that were so, it would be
necessary for the plaintiffs to have proved that:

1. Autoerotic asphyxiation is a lawless act.
2. Hustler advocated this act.
3. Hustler's publication went even beyond "mere advocacy" and amounted
to incitement.
4. The incitement was directed to imminent action.

The *Brandenburg* focus is repeated in subsequent Supreme Court
decisions. Thus, in *Hess v. Indiana,* the Court held
provocative remarks by a demonstrator to the police could not be
punished on the basis that they had a tendency to lead to violence
because there was no evidence that, or rational inference from, the
import of the language that "[the] words [used] were intended to
produce, and likely to produce, *imminent* disorder."

The crucial element to lowering the first amendment shield is the
imminence of the threatened evil. In *Hess,* the Court was faced with
the question of whether an antiwar demonstrator could be punished under
Indiana's disorderly conduct statute for loudly shouting, "We'll take
the fucking street later," as police attempted to move the crowd of
demonstrators off the street so that vehicles could pass. The Court
noted that, viewed most favorably to the speaker, "the statement could
be taken as counsel for moderation" and, at worst, as "advocacy of
illegal action at some indefinite future time." The Court
reasoned that, "[s]ince the uncontroverted evidence showed that Hess'
statement was not directed to any person or group of persons, it cannot
be said that he was advocating, in the normal sense, any action. And
since there was no evidence or rational inference from the import of the
language, that his words were intended to produce, and likely to
produce, *imminent* disorder, those words could not be punished ... on
the ground that they had \`a tendency to lead to
violence.'"

We need not decide whether Texas law made autoerotic asphyxiation
illegal or whether *Brandenburg* is restricted to the advocacy of
criminal conduct. Even if the article paints in glowing terms the
pleasures  supposedly achieved by the practice it describes,
as the plaintiffs contend, no fair reading of it can make its content
advocacy, let alone incitement to engage in the practice.&hellip;

### Civil Liability? 

Herceg and Andy V. contend that, while the first amendment might prevent
the state from punishing publication of such articles as criminal, it
does not foreclose imposing civil liability for damages that result from
publication. In [*New York Times v.
Sullivan*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*,*
the Supreme Court held, "what a State may not constitutionally bring
about by means of a criminal statute is likewise beyond the reach of its
civil law of libel," because the fear of civil liberty might be
"markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal
statute." The same rationale forbids the state to impose
damages for publication of "Orgasm of Death" if it could not
constitutionally make the publication of that article a crime.

One state Supreme Court decision, however, may be read to imply that the
state may impose civil liability in such a situation. In *Weirum v. RKO
General, Inc.,* the Supreme Court of California held that
a radio station catering primarily to teenagers could be held liable for
wrongful death damages arising from an accident caused when two youths
who listened to a promotional broadcast engaged in a street race in
order to be the first to reach the site at which the station had
announced prize money would be given away. Most  of the
opinion dealt with whether the radio station owed a duty of care to the
killed non-listener, and the first amendment defense was summarily
rejected because "[t]he First Amendment does not sanction the infliction
of physical injury merely because achieved by word, rather than
act."

As the California court itself noted, "virtually every act involves some
conceivable danger." The analysis employed by the
California Supreme Court, however, provides no guidance for
distinguishing between protected speech containing — or implying —
dangerous ideas and speech so clearly and immediately dangerous and "of
such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be
derived from [it] is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order
and morality." Because the speech challenged was merely a
promotional device to encourage listeners to continue listening to the
radio station, it may have been entitled only to limited first amendment
protection. The broadcast announcements included
light-hearted warnings that listeners should "get your kids out of the
street" because of the reckless driving that the
announcement might incite, and no warning of any kind was given to urge
listeners who sought to win the prizes to use discretion in driving. In
contrast, the Hustler article, while published in a magazine published
for profit, was not an effort to achieve a commercial result and, at
least in the explicit meaning of the words employed, attempts to
dissuade its readers from conducting the dangerous activity it
describes.&hellip;

In the alternative, Herceg and Andy suggest that a less stringent
standard than the *Brandenburg* test be applied in cases involving
non-political speech that has actually produced harm. Although political
speech is at "the core of the First Amendment," the
Supreme Court generally has not attempted to differentiate between
different categories of protected speech for the purposes of deciding
how much constitutional protection is required. Such an
endeavor would not only be hopelessly complicated but would raise
substantial concern that the worthiness of speech might be judged by
majoritarian notions of political and social propriety and morality. If
the shield of the first amendment can be eliminated by proving after
publication that an article discussing a dangerous idea negligently
helped bring about a real injury simply because the idea can be
identified as "bad," all free speech becomes threatened. An article
discussing the nature and danger of "crack" usage — or of hang-gliding —
might lead to liability just as easily. As is made clear in the Supreme
Court's decision in *Hess,* the "tendency to lead to violence" is not
enough. Mere negligence, therefore, cannot form the basis
of liability under the incitement doctrine any more than it can under
libel doctrine.&hellip;

For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is
REVERSED.

### Concurrence & Dissent

EDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge, Concurring and Dissenting:

I concur in the result in this case only because I am persuaded that
plaintiffs had an obligation to cross-appeal the court's dismissal of
their claims based on negligence, attractive nuisance, and strict
liability or dangerous instrumentality. The majority correctly reason
that Hustler should have had an opportunity to prepare a defense
specifically tailored against any of these theories. Although I believe
a tort claim is here defensible, the undeniable novelty of plaintiff's
"incitement" theory does not permit us fairly to support the judgment
below.

What disturbs me to the point of despair is the majority's broad
reasoning which appears to foreclose the possibility that any state
might choose to temper the excesses of the pornography business by
imposing civil liability for harms it directly causes. Consonant with
the first amendment, the state can protect its citizens against the
moral evil of obscenity, the threat of civil disorder or
injury posed by lawless mobs and fighting
words, and the damage to reputation from libel or
defamation, to say nothing of the myriad dangers lurking
in "commercial speech." Why cannot the state then fashion
a remedy to protect its children's lives when they are endangered by
suicidal pornography? To deny this possibility, I believe, is to degrade
the free market of ideas to a level with the black market for heroin.
Despite the grand  flourishes of rhetoric in many first
amendment decisions concerning the sanctity of "dangerous" ideas, no
federal court has held that death is a legitimate price to pay for
freedom of speech.

In less emotional terms, I believe the majority has critically erred in
its analysis of this case under existing first amendment law. The
majority decide at the outset that Hustler's "Orgasm of Death" does not
embody child pornography, fighting words, incitement to lawless conduct,
libel, defamation or fraud, or obscenity, all of which
categories of speech are entirely unprotected by the first amendment.
Nor do they find in the article "an effort to achieve a commercial
result," which would afford it modified first amendment protection.
Comforted by the inapplicability of these labels, they then accord this
article full first amendment protection, holding that in the balance
struck between society's interest in Troy's life and the chilling effect
on the "right of the public to receive ... ideas," Troy loses. Any
effort to find a happier medium, they conclude, would not only be
hopelessly complicated but would raise substantial concerns that the
worthiness of speech might be judged by "majoritarian notions of
political and social propriety and morality." I agree that "Orgasm of
Death" does not conveniently match the current categories of speech
defined for first amendment purposes. Limiting its constitutional
protection does not, however, disserve any of these categories and is
more appropriate to furthering the "majoritarian" notion of protecting
the sanctity of human life. Finally, the "slippery slope" argument that
if Hustler is held liable here, *Ladies Home Journal* or the publisher
of an article on hang-gliding will next be a casualty of philistine
justice simply proves too much: *This* case is not a difficult one in
which to vindicate Troy's loss of life.

#### I.

Proper analysis must begin with an examination of *Hustler* generally
and this article in particular. *Hustler* is not a bona fide competitor
in the "marketplace of ideas." It is largely pornographic, whether or
not technically obscene. One need not be male to recognize that the
principal function of this magazine is to create sexual arousal.
Consumers of this material so partake for its known physical effects
much as they would use tobacco, alcohol or drugs for their effects. By
definition, pornography's appeal is therefore non-cognitive and
unrelated to, in fact exactly the opposite of, the transmission of
ideas.

Not only is Hustler's appeal noncognitive, but the magazine derives its
profit from that fact. If Hustler stopped being pornographic, its
readership would vanish.

According to the trial court record, pornography appeals to pubescent
males. Moreover, although sold in the "adults only" section of
newsstands, a significant portion of its readers are adolescent. Hustler
knows this. Such readers are particularly vulnerable to thrillseeking,
recklessness, and mimickry. Hustler should know this. Hustler should
understand that to such a mentality the warnings "no" or "caution" may
be treated as invitations rather than taboos.

"Orgasm of Death" provides a detailed description how to accomplish
autoerotic asphyxiation. The article appears in the "Sexplay" section of
the magazine which, among other things, purports to advise its readers
on "how to make you a much better lover." The warnings and
cautionary comments in the article could be seen by a jury to conflict
with both the explicit and subliminal message of Hustler, which is to
tear down custom, explode myths and banish  taboos about
sexual matters. The article trades on the symbiotic connection between
sex and violence. In sum, as Hustler knew, the article is
dangerously explicit, lethal, and likely to be distributed to those
members of society who are most vulnerable to its message. "Orgasm of
Death," in the circumstances of its publication and dissemination, is
not unlike a dangerous nuisance or a stick of dynamite in the hands of a
child. Hustler's publication of this particular article bears the seeds
of tort liability although, as I shall explain, the theory on which the
case was tried is incorrect.

#### II.

First amendment analysis is an exercise in line-drawing between the
legitimate interests of society to regulate itself and the paramount
necessity of encouraging the robust and uninhibited flow of debate which
is the life-blood of government by the people. That some of the lines
are blurred or irregular does not, however, prove the majority's
proposition that it would be hopelessly complicated to delineate between
protected and unprotected speech in this case. Such a formulation in
fact begs the critical question in two ways. First, a hierarchy of first
amendment speech classifications has in fact developed largely in the
last few years, and there is no reason to assume the
hierarchy is ineluctable. Second, the essence of the judicial function
is to judge. If it is impossible to judge, there is no reason for judges
to pretend to perform their role, and it is a nonsequitur for them to
conclude that society's or a state's judgment is "wrong." Hence, in
novel cases like this one, the reasons for protecting speech under the
first amendment must be closely examined to properly evaluate Hustler's
claim to unlimited constitutional protection.&hellip;

The interest in protecting life is recognized specifically for first
amendment purposes and, analytically, can be no less important than the
interest in reputation. The state's interest in this case is to protect
the lives of adolescents who might be encouraged by pornographic
publications and specifically instructed how to attempt life-threatening
activities. In [*NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Company,* 458 U.S. 886, 102
S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215
(1982),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7271075303659098319&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the Supreme Court assumed that if violence had broken out as a result of
Charles Evers' incendiary speech, both the mob and the speaker could
have been subjected to damage claims by the victims. For similar
reasons, "fighting words" have long been outside the sphere of first
amendment protection. *See* [*Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,* 315 U.S.
568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031
(1942)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=124249671461500618&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
The Supreme Court has also dealt favorably with state regulations
designed to protect minors from performing sexual acts by prohibiting
distribution of films containing such acts. [*New York v. Ferber,* 458
U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113
(1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
There the Court found it "evident beyond the need for elaboration that a
State's interest in \`safeguarding the physical and psychological
wellbeing of a minor' is \`compelling'." [458 U.S. at 756-57, 102 S.Ct.
at
3354,](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(quoting [*Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court,* 457 U.S. 596, 607,
102 S.Ct. 2613, 2620, 73 L.Ed.2d 248
(1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9138451588502129368&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)).
The Court has even gone so far as to uphold an FCC regulation banning
"indecent" speech from the airwaves at the times when children would be
in the audience. [*F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation,* 438 U.S. 726, 98
S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073
(1978)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9738309099999149495&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
States already regulate the distribution of pornography to minors, *see*
Schauer, *supra* n. 9, at 196-97, and a remedy for the collateral
consequences of unauthorized distribution, by way of a civil action for
damages, would only serve to reinforce that regulation.

Permitting recovery of damages in defamation cases offers an analogous
framework. Balanced against the state interest, the Court held in *Dun &
Bradstreet* that the first amendment interest at stake was less
important than the one weighed in *Gertz.* [472 U.S. at 758, 105 S.Ct.
at
2945](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14343170427684392260&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
While *Gertz* involved a libelous publication on a matter of public
concern, the false information in *Dun & Bradstreet* was contained in a
credit report distributed to merchants. The Court employed the test of
content, form and context, best articulated in [*Connick v. Myers,* 461
U.S. 138, 148-49, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1690, 75 L.Ed.2d 708
(1983),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12292534138488546769&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
to analyze whether the credit report was a matter of "public concern."
Speech on matters of "private concern," the Court found, while not
wholly unprotected, is not as substantial relative to important state
interests. Thus, the credit report was prepared solely for the
individual interest of the speaker and a specific business, it was false
and clearly damaging, and, like advertising, it represents a form of
speech unlikely to be deterred by incidental state regulation: The
credit report involved a matter of "private concern."

Measured by this standard, both *Hustler* in general and "Orgasm of
Death" in particular deserve limited only first amendment protection.
*Hustler* is a profitable commercial enterprise trading on its prurient
appeal to a small portion of the population. It deliberately borders on
technical obscenity, which would be wholly unprotected, to achieve its
purposes, and its appeal is not based on cognitive or intellectual
appreciation. Because of the solely commercial and
pandering nature of the magazine, neither *Hustler* nor any other
pornographic publication is likely to be deterred by incidental state
regulation. No sensitive first amendment genius is required to see that,
as the Court concluded in *Dun & Bradstreet,* "[t]here is simply no
credible argument that this type of [speech] requires special protection
to insure that 'debate on public issues [will] be uninhibited, robust,
and wide-open.'" [472 U.S. at 762, 105 S.Ct. at
2947,](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14343170427684392260&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
(quoting [*New York
Times*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)[*Co.
v. Sullivan,* 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 721, 11 L.Ed.2d 686
(1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)).

To place *Hustler* effectively on a par with *Dun & Bradstreet*'s
"private speech" or with commercial speech, for purposes
of permitting tort lawsuits against it hardly portends the end of
participatory democracy, as some might contend. First, any given issue
of Hustler may be found legally obscene and therefore entitled to no
first amendment protection. Second, tort liability would result
after-the-fact, not as a prior restraint, and would be based on harm
directly caused by the publication in issue. *See* [*NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware Co.,* 458 U.S. at 917-919, 102 S.Ct. at
3427-28](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7271075303659098319&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0).
Third, to the extent any chilling effect existed from the exposure to
tort liability, this would, in my view, protect society from loss of
life and limb, a legitimate, indeed compelling, state interest. Fourth,
obscenity has been widely regulated by prior restraints for over a
century. Before [*Roth v. United States,* 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1
L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14778925784015245625&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
there was no *Hustler* magazine and it would probably have been banned.
Despite such regulation, it does not appear that the pre-*Roth* era was
a political dark age. Conversely, increasing leniency on pornography in
the past three decades has allowed pornography to flourish, but it does
not seem to have corresponded with an increased quality of debate on
"public" issues. These observations imply that pornography bears little
connection to the core values of the first amendment and that political
democracy has endured previously in the face of "majoritarian notions of
social propriety."

Rendering accountable the more vicious excesses of
pornography by allowing damage recovery for tort victims
imposes on its purveyors a responsibility which is insurable, much like
a manufacturer's responsibility to warn against careless use of its
products. A tort remedy which compensates death or abuse of youthful
victims clearly caused by a specific pornographic publication would be
unlikely to "chill" the pornography industry any more than unfavorable
zoning ordinances or the threat of obscenity
prosecution has done. The reasonableness of allowing a
tort remedy in cases like this is reinforced by the fact that only one
lawsuit was filed in regard to "Orgasm of Death." The analogy with
regulations on commercial speech is not inappropriate: pornography
should assume a lower value on the scale of constitutional protection;
and the state regulation by means of tort recovery for injury directly
caused by pornography is appropriate when tailored to specific harm and
not broader than necessary to accomplish its purpose. 

The foregoing analysis immediately differentiates this case from [*Brandenburg v. Ohio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0), which addressed prior restraints on public advocacy of controversial
political ideas. Placing *Hustler* on the same analytical plane with
*Brandenburg* represents an unwarranted extension of that holding,
which, unlike *Dun & Bradstreet* and the commercial speech cases, rests
in the core values protected by the first amendment. Even *Brandenburg,*
however, recognized that the state's regulatory interest
legitimately extends to protecting the lives of its citizens from
violence induced by speech. Moreover, *Brandenburg* is intertwined with
the context of the speech as well as its content — advocacy of inciteful
ideas would thus be differently regarded in a collection of speeches by
Tom Paine than it is among a crowd of armed vigilantes who proceed to
riot. The *Brandenburg* test, implicitly rejected by the majority, is
simply inappropriate to define the limits of constitutional protection
afforded in this case. Viewed in the overall context of
first amendment jurisprudence, moreover, *Brandenburg* does not exclude
the possibility of state regulation.

## III.

Texas courts have never been called upon to assess a claim like this
one. Since there is no cross-appeal, we should not speculate on the
precise nature of the theory of liability a Texas court might accept,
although negligence and attractive nuisance seem theoretically
appropriate. Texas law supplies no reason to conclude, as
the district court did, that [*Brandenburg v.
Ohio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15538842772335942956&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)*,*
representing a federal constitutional limitation on a state's restraints
on speech, could be turned into an affirmative theory of tort law. I
believe this use of *Brandenburg* is wrong, insofar as it suggests that
federal constitutional law rather than state law governs the first issue
in this case, which is the nature of the tort committed by Hustler.

Eliminating the *Brandenburg* incitement theory as a basis for recovery
would have been sufficient to reverse the jury award here. The majority
go much further, however, and afford *Hustler* virtually complete
protection from tort liability under the first amendment. I vigorously
oppose their unnecessary elaboration on first amendment law, which, I
believe, will undercut the ability of the states to protect their youth
against a reckless and sometimes dangerous business which masquerades as
a beneficiary of the first amendment.

End of excerpts from Judge Edith Grossman's concurring & dissenting opinion.

#### Note on *Weirum v. RKO*

In [*Weirum v. RKO,* 15 Cal.3d 40, 123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539
P.2d 36
(1975),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=836093554391354911&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the Supreme Court of California held a radio station liable for
broadcasting a promotional event which caused the teenage listeners to
participate in a high-speed chase in the Los Angeles freeways killing a
motorist. There was a direct connection between the station's broadcast
and the fatal accident. In [*Hyde v. Missouri,* 637 S.W.2d 251
(Mo.Ct.App.1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6013208883755367940&q=herceg+hustler&hl=en&as_sdt=6,28&scilh=0)
the court held a newspaper and other defendants liable for publishing
the name of a victim of a sexual assault while her attacker was still at
large. The causal connection between the published information and the
attacker's continued threats to the victim was again straightforward.
